<h1>DEEP SEA HUNTERS IN THE FROZEN SEAS</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NARWHAL</span></h2>

<p>Old Cap’n Pem was seated on the stringpiece
of the wharf, his short black pipe gripped
firmly in his mouth, and his wooden leg
stretched stiffly before him like the stubby bowsprit
of a coasting sloop. Beside him was his crony, Mike,
another wooden-legged old mariner, for since a cruise
the two had made to the Antarctic on the bark <i>Hector</i>,
they had become inseparable companions.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Although they were fast friends, they were ever
chaffing each other and made it a point never to agree
upon anything.</p>

<p>As Mike said, “Phwhat’s the use av talkin’ if yez
don’t be afther arguin’? Shure an’ if yez agrees
there’s not a bit more to be said.”</p>

<p>So, as usual, the two ancient mariners were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
midst of a discussion regarding a weather-beaten,
disreputable, unkempt craft which was being towed
across New Bedford harbor by a fussy little tug.</p>

<p>“Looks like they wuz a-comin’ to berth her here,”
remarked Old Pem. “Reckon Dixon mus’ calc’late
to fit the ol’ <i>Narwhal</i> out fer a cruise.”</p>

<p>Mike snorted. “B’gorra thin ’twill be a cruise to
Davy Jones she’ll be afther takin’!” he exclaimed.
“Shure, ’tis l’ave o’ yer sinses ye’re takin’, ye ol’ walrus!
’Tis to junk the schooner they do be towin’ av
her here.”</p>

<p>“Walrus yerself!” retorted Cap’n Pem. “Ye’re
a Irish lan’lubber if ye think the ol’ <i>Narwhal’s</i> only
fit for junk. That there ol’ hooker’s a-goin’ for to
fit out, I bet ye. An’, by heck! if she do, I’ll be
blowed if I don’t ask Dixon to ship me erlong.”</p>

<p>Mike guffawed. “Glory be!” he cried. “An’ do
yez be afther thinkin’ as Dixon’ll be fittin’ out av a
floatin’ horspittle, ye ol’ cripple?”</p>

<p>Pem bristled. “Dern yer hide!” he roared. “If
he was I’ll be sunk if he wouldn’t grab ye fust, ye
peg-legged Harp. I’d——”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem’s sentence was interrupted by a shout
and Jim Lathrop and Tom Chester, who had been
with the old whalemen on the <i>Hector</i> in the Antarctic,
came racing towards them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Tom. “That tug’s coming in
here with that old brig. Say, Cap’n Pem, what do
you suppose they’re going to do with her?”</p>

<p>“Bless ye, that ain’t no brig,” responded the old
man. “That’s a torpsa’l schooner—the ol’ <i>Narwhal</i>.
Ain’t seed her afloat fer years. Reckon Dixon’s
goin’ fer to fit her out fer a cruise.”</p>

<p>“Cruise!” cried Jim. “Gee, you don’t mean to
say any one would be crazy enough to go to sea on
her! Why, the old <i>Hector</i> was bad enough, but she
was new compared to that tub, and was big enough
to hoist this boat up to her davits.”</p>

<p>Mike chuckled. “Glory be!” he exclaimed.
“Even the b’ys is afther knowin’ ’tis no cruise she’ll
be takin’. Shure, me laddies, Oi wuz just afther
tellin’ Pem ’twas a-junkin’ av her they’ll be. But
b’gorra, he’ll be havin’ av it his own way an’, phwat’s
more, the ol’ idjit’s a-sayin’ as he’ll be afther a-tryin’
to ship along av her.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed. “I thought you were never going
to sea again, Cap’n Pem,” cried Tom. “You said
you were going to settle down ashore and buy a farm
with your share of the <i>Hector’s</i> catch.”</p>

<p>“And you said only an old fool like Mr. Nye would
ship a wooden-legged mate,” put in Jim. “Isn’t Mike
going too to keep you company?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Divvil a bit!” declared Mike positively. “’Tis
solid land Oi do be afther wantin’ to feel ben’ath me
two feet—an’ me havin’ but wan.”</p>

<p>“Waall, I’ll bet ye she’s a-goin’ fer a cruise annyways,”
rumbled Cap’n Pem, “an’ we’ll soon fin’ out.”</p>

<p>Rising, the old whaleman stumped across the dock
to where the ancient craft was being moored. At his
heels followed the two boys and Mike.</p>

<p>“Hey there, Ben!” shouted the old sailor to the
captain of the tug. “What in tarnation ye bringin’
the <i>Narwhal</i> over here fer?”</p>

<p>The tug’s skipper stuck his head from the pilot
house, twirled the big wheel with one hand, and
jerked the bell pull with the other. “Goin’ for a
cruise,” he shouted back. “Heard Dixon’s aimin’
to send her to the Arctic.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem turned triumphantly to Mike. “There
ye be, ye ol’ derelic’,” he cried. “Didn’t I tell
ye?”</p>

<p>“Faith an’ yez did thot,” admitted Mike good-naturedly.
“An’ by the same token, ’tis goin’ along av
her ye’ll be jus’ fer to be afther provin’ yez was right
altogether.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m ready to believe anything now,” declared
Tom. “You remember I thought you were
fooling about the <i>Hector</i> when you said she was fitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
out, and I never dreamed we’d go on her. And she
<em>was</em> a fine old ship! Gosh, do you remember the
way she went through that blow in the south Atlantic,
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Do I!” replied Jim enthusiastically. “And say,
I shouldn’t wonder if this old <i>Narwhal’s</i> just as
staunch a ship too, after she’s fixed up.”</p>

<p>“Bet ye she will be!” exclaimed Cap’n Pem. “I
tol’ ye whaleships wuz built to las’ forever, and this
here <i>Narwhal</i> ain’t so drefful ol’. Why, I can recollec’
when she wuz new. Le’s see, reckon I must ha’
been ’bout the size o’ ye, an’ she warn’t more’n twenty
year ol’ then. Yep, I’ll bet she ain’t much older’n I
be.”</p>

<p>“B’gorra, an’ that’s a-plenty,” chuckled Mike.
“An’ faith, ’tis a foine pair yez do be afther makin’!
Shure yes, Pem, for the love o’ Hivvin be afther
shippin’ on her—’tis comp’ny yez’ll be for wan
another.”</p>

<p>“And the captain of the tug said she was going to
the Arctic!” cried Jim, paying no heed to Mike’s interruption.
“Do you suppose they’re going after
whales, Cap’n Pem?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” replied the whaleman. “Reckon they’re
goin’ fer mos’ anythin’ what they gets. Seals, walrus,
furs, ile an’ bone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Furs!” exclaimed Tom inquiringly. “What kind
of furs do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Different kinds,” replied Pem. “White b’ar, fox,
musk ox, reindeer, anythin’ what the Eskimos bring
in or the hands on the schooner kin shoot.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, wouldn’t it be fun to go!” shouted Jim.
“Say, Tom, I’m going to ask Dad if I can go. That
is, if Cap’n Pem goes. Now we’ve been on the <i>Hector</i>
and everything came out so well I’ll bet he’ll let
me.”</p>

<p>“Me too!” declared Tom. “Say, that will be
bully!”</p>

<p>“’Tis daffy yez all do be afther gettin’!” declared
Mike shaking his grizzled head sadly. “Furrst ’tis
ol’ timber-lig here an’ thin ’tis yez b’ys—goin’ to look
afther him Oi’m thinkin’, an’ ’tis meself’ll have to be
afther goin’ along to be lookin’ afther the three of
yez.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you old fox!” cried Tom. “You know you’re
just as crazy to go on another trip as any of us.
You said yourself that voyage on the <i>Hector</i> made a
man of you. And you’d never be happy ashore without
Cap’n Pem.”</p>

<p>“Shure, Oi dunno but phwat it’s the truth yez do be
afther sp’akin’, Master Tom,” agreed the Irishman
grinning. “But b’gorra ’tis wan thing to be talkin’ av
goin’ an’ another to be aboarrd. Shure ’tis no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
knowin’ as Misther Dixon’ll be afther takin’ anny av
us, at all, at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to find out if we can go first—before
we ask him,” said Jim. “And if we can, I’ll
bet we can get Mr. Dixon to take you and Cap’n Pem.
Mr. Nye and Captain Edwards can put in a good word
for you, and besides, everybody in New Bedford
knows you’re the two best whalemen here, and real
whalemen are scarce nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis havin’ av me doots Oi do be, as the
Scotchman sez,” declared Mike. “Cruisin’ to the
Ar’tic’s not a bit the same as cruisin’ south—phwat
wid the oice an’ all.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” snorted Cap’n Pem. “What do ye
know erbout it? Ye ain’t no whaleman. Bet ye he’ll
be right glad fer to git us. ’Tain’t so all-fired easy
to git navergators these times. An’ I’ve been in the
ice—why, durn it, wuzn’t I ice pilot fer the ol’
<i>Petrel</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he will take you—both,” said Tom.
“Our folks will be more likely to let us go if you two
are along. When do you think the schooner’ll be
ready to sail? And say, I never saw a schooner like
her. She’s got yards on her foremast like a brigantine.”</p>

<p>“Course she has,” replied Cap’n Pem. “Thet’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
what makes her a torps’l schooner. Didn’t ye never
seed one afore? But shucks, ’course ye didn’t.
Ain’t many on ’em knockin’ erbout nowadays. Time
wuz when they wuz thicker’n rats on a lime juicer.
Yessir, an’ mighty handy craf’ in the ice, I tell ye.
Thet’s why Dixon’s a-fittin’ o’ the <i>Narwhal</i> out I
’spect. Ye see a or’nary fore-an’-aft schooner’s all
right fer a-sailin’ on the wind, or when the win’s on
the quarter or abeam, but she ain’t no use dead afore
it, an’ ye can’t back her. An’ by glory! I’m a-tellin’
ye that when ye’re a-handlin’ of a ship in the ice,
with bergs fore-an’-aft an’ to po’t an’ sta’board, an’
jes leads in the floes, ye wants a ship what kin back
an’ fill an’ make steerageway st’arn fummust. Yessir,
an’ the torps’l schooner’s the hooker what fills the
bill. An’ as fer gettin’ ready, how can I tell?
Reckon if there ain’t too pesky much to be did, she’ll
be gettin’ away long ’bout the fust o’ June. Have ter
fetch Hudson Straits by fust o’ August to git
through safe an’ soun’.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! that makes it all the better,” cried Tom.
“School will be pretty near over and we could miss
a few days—at the last. There’s just a lot of graduation
exercises and such things. Come on, Jim, let’s
go and see what our folks say.”</p>

<p>But the boys’ parents frowned upon the scheme at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
once. “That cruise in the <i>Hector</i> should be enough
to last you boys for a lifetime,” declared Mr. Lathrop.
“And a cruise to the Arctic is a very different
matter. The <i>Narwhal’s</i> a very old and small ship,
and she’ll spend the winter there probably, freeze in
and take chances of being crushed. And you’d find
it far from a picnic. Why, just imagine being locked
hard and fast in the ice for six or eight months with
the temperature fifty or sixty below zero, and shut up
in the ship with a crowd of greasy whalers and Eskimos.
No, Jim, there’s far too much risk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it all!” cried Jim bitterly. “You said
there’d be danger on the <i>Hector</i> and everything was
all right, and I’d love to be in the ice all winter and
see Eskimos and hunt polar bears and walrus and
everything. Say, if Cap’n Pem and Mike go, can’t
I go too?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lathrop shook his head decisively. “If the
entire crew of the <i>Hector</i> went along, I’d not consent,”
he declared. “But I’ll ask Tom’s father and see if
he agrees with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chester, however, was as much against the idea
as Jim’s parent. “No, Tom,” he said, after Tom
had explained matters. “It would mean a year from
school at least, and while I realize the knowledge you
boys would obtain would be of real value, still it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
too risky a trip. You’d be frozen in for six months
or more, the ship might be stove—in which case you
might be killed or might be marooned in the Arctic
for months or years—or she might strike a berg or a
floe and founder. Arctic whaling’s dangerous, and I
don’t feel sure the <i>Narwhal</i> is seaworthy. Besides, I
don’t know who Dixon is sending as ice pilot. It’s
been years since a New Bedford whaler went to the
Arctic and it takes men experienced in the ice to
bring the ships through safely.”</p>

<p>“But Cap’n Pem was an ice pilot—on the <i>Petrel</i>,”
argued Tom. “And you have faith in him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chester laughed. “Yes, as far as looking
after you boys to the best of his ability and being a
good whaleman is concerned. But don’t for a moment
think that Dixon will ship him or Mike. In
the Arctic they need able-bodied young men—half
the work is done ashore and there are long tramps
over ice and snow. No, Tom, Cap’n Pem won’t go,
that’s certain.”</p>

<p>“You said that about the <i>Hector</i>,” Tom reminded
him. “And yet he went. Oh, Dad, if Cap’n Pem
and Mike go, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you want me to make another bargain,”
chuckled his father, “and make a condition that seems
impossible but may be fulfilled. No, Tom, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Cap’n Pem went I would hesitate to consent. But
I’ll tell you what. If the owners of the <i>Narwhal</i> invite
you to go—remember you’re not to ask them—and
if they guarantee that they’ll be personally responsible
for your safety, then I’ll consent.”</p>

<p>“Well that’s poor comfort!” exclaimed the disappointed
boy. “Just as if the owners are going to invite
us without even knowing we want to go, and as if
they’d be responsible for us! Gee, they’d have to
double their insurance, I guess.”</p>

<p>“One’s as likely as the other, I admit,” laughed
Mr. Chester. “But don’t be so disappointed, Tom.
Maybe there’ll be a ship going to the West Indies or
the Atlantic this summer that you can go on—some
short cruise.”</p>

<p>“Bother the West Indies!” cried Tom petulantly.
“I want to go to the Arctic, and maybe Mr. Dixon
may take Cap’n Edwards and maybe he or Cap’n Pem
or some one may tell him we can navigate, and if he
wants mates perhaps he will ask us.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he does you can go—that is, of course, if
Jim goes too,” smiled Tom’s father. “But remember
you’re neither to ask, nor hint about it. And I
don’t think you’ll need to get out your winter things
this June.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BOYS SPRING A SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>The following day the two boys wandered to
the wharf with disconsolate faces.</p>

<p>“Reckon yer folks didn’t take to the idee,
hey?” ventured Cap’n Pem, as he turned from watching
a gang of men working on the old <i>Narwhal</i>.</p>

<p>“No, they wouldn’t listen to us,” replied Tom.
“Not even if you and Mike went. Dad said if the
owners invited us—and we didn’t ask—and that if
you and Mike went too, he’d let us, but there’s a swell
chance of that.”</p>

<p>“H-m-m!” muttered the old whaleman. “Waall,
I dunno as I’d be so everlastin’ly cut up about it. I
don’t reckon ye’d have went annyhow without me, an’
there ain’t one chance in a million o’ that. Mike was
up to see Dixon and the ol’ grampus jes laffed at
him. Asked what he thought the <i>Narwhal</i> wuz—a
floatin’ old sailors’ home?”</p>

<p>“The mean old thing!” cried Jim. “Say, I’ll bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he won’t get a man that’s as good a sailor as you or
Mike.”</p>

<p>“Is he the owner?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Wall, not perzactly,” replied the old man. “He’s
the agent. The <i>Narwhal’s</i> owned by a comp’ny—an’
I reckon they ain’t none too conf’dent o’ the cruise
a-bein’ so everlastin’ly profit’ble. Mike says he saw
Cap’n Edwards an’ ol’ Nye, a-tryin’ fer to get ’em to
put in a word fer us, an’ Nye says as how they’s a
lot o’ shares—or stock or whatever ye calls it—what
ain’t been took up yit. He’s thinkin’ o’ buyin’ on it
hisself if he kin git a good skipper like Edwards.”</p>

<p>Tom let out a yell like an Indian, threw his hat in
the air and danced.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he fairly screamed. “We <em>can</em> go!
I’ve a scheme! Oh, Jim! Oh, Cap’n Pem! It’s
bully! Oh gosh, we’ll put one over on Dad again!”</p>

<p>“Whatever be ye talkin’ on?” demanded the
old whaleman. “’Pears like ye’ve gone plumb
crazy.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Tom, as he quieted down. And in
earnest tones he explained his scheme to old Pem
and to Jim.</p>

<p>“Gee!” commented Jim, “that <em>will</em> work. Tom,
you’re a wonder.”</p>

<p>“Derned if ’twont,” agreed the old whaleman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“I’ll be swabbed if I don’ reckon we’ll all be a-goin’
erlong o’ the <i>Narwhal</i> arter all.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the boys were speeding towards
New Bedford on a trolley car. Alighting
near the water front they hurried to Mr. Nye’s office.</p>

<p>There was a long conference with the genial shipowner.
Then another visit, with Mr. Nye accompanying
them, to a broker’s and to a law office. Several
hours later two grinning, jubilant boys made
their way back to Fair Haven and entered Mr. Chester’s
home.</p>

<p>“Well, Dad, they’ve invited us!” exclaimed Tom,
as his father turned at their entrance.</p>

<p>“What?” cried Mr. Chester incredulously. “You
mean to say the <i>Narwhal’s</i> owners have asked you to
go on a cruise—without your mentioning it to them?”</p>

<p>Tom grinned and Jim chuckled. “They sure
did,” declared Tom. “And they’re going to take
Cap’n Pem and Cap’n Edwards and Mike—and Ned
if they can find him—and all the others that were on
the <i>Hector</i> that can be hired.”</p>

<p>“But how—how on earth did they know you wanted
to go?” demanded Tom’s father, “and why are they
going to take that crew of cripples? There’s a
mystery here, boys; what is it?”</p>

<p>The two boys were thoroughly enjoying themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“And that’s not all, Dad,” went on Tom. “The
owners said that if Jim and I couldn’t go, the <i>Narwhal’s</i>
cruise would be given up—they wouldn’t even
fit her out.”</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> all this nonsense?” exclaimed Mr. Chester.
“The owners must be crazy—talking about giving
up a cruise if you two kids don’t go along! Who
<em>are</em> the owners of the old ship anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see it’s a company,” explained Tom,
scarcely able to control himself, “and the members
who own the most shares are managing owners and
have the say about everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I understand all that,” interrupted Mr.
Chester impatiently, “but who <em>are</em> the managing
owners?”</p>

<p>Jim could contain himself no longer. “We are!”
he shouted. “Tom and I!”</p>

<p>Mr. Chester was speechless. “What?” he gasped
presently. “You two boys are the ship’s owners?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say we are!” cried Tom. “We took the
money we got for our lays of the ambergris and
bought up the controlling shares to-day. Mr. Nye
said it was a good investment. And so we invited
ourselves, and we won’t let the <i>Narwhal</i> sail unless
we go, and we’re going to hire all the old <i>Hector’s</i>
crew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well I’ll be——” began Mr. Chester, and then,
a smile broadening on his face, he turned to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed presently. “That you,
Lathrop? Well, the boys have put one over on us
two old fogies again! Yes, owners invited them all
right. Say the ship won’t sail without them too.
Yes. Guess we’ll have to let them go. Oh, Edwards.
Yes, both Mike and Pem. Oh, yes, I forgot—Tom
and Jim bought up the controlling interest—managing
owners themselves. Ha, ha! Yes, they’ve
won out!”</p>

<p>“Then we can go!” cried Tom, as his father hung
up the receiver.</p>

<p>“I always stick to a bargain,” replied Mr. Chester,
“and Jim’s father says he does too. So you might as
well hire your crew and get the old <i>Narwhal</i> fitted
out.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem and Mike were as tickled as two children
over the boys’ ruse and its success. Both the
old sailors having been engaged, they set to work,
Cap’n Pem looking after the details of reconditioning
the schooner, while Mike haunted New Bedford’s
water front and lodging houses, searching out the
former crew of the <i>Hector</i>.</p>

<p>The next few weeks were very busy ones for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
two boys, who had invested their little fortune in the
<i>Narwhal</i>, and now found themselves the principal
owners of a real whaling vessel. The details of the
business, as well as the financial arrangements, repairs,
and outfitting were turned over to Mr. Dixon
and to Mr. Nye, for the latter had bought considerable
stock in the <i>Narwhal</i> also. And work proceeded rapidly
aboard the ship.</p>

<p>There seemed to be an endless number of things to
be done. The old ship’s timbers were in good shape
and little of her planking had to be replaced, but
she had to be caulked and pitched and painted and
ice sheathing was put on. Her spars were worthless
and her rigging had to be entirely stripped from
her, and new rigging rove. Much of her decks were
also badly rotted and, as Tom said, when on one occasion
he looked ruefully at the almost empty hulk,
minus masts and rigging, “By the time they get
through she’ll be a new ship.”</p>

<p>But old Cap’n Pem did not agree with him.
“Hanged if she will!” he exclaimed, “why, Lor’
love ye, ’tain’t a ship’s spars an’ riggin’ what makes
the ship. It’s the timbers an’ hull. Bless my soul!
If ev’ry time a ship got dismasted an’ had ter have
a new set o’ spars, it made a new ship of her, thar
wouldn’t be nary an ol’ ship lef’. Shucks! Ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
wouldn’t say yer Dad built a new house jes ’cause
he put a new chimbly or a new verandy on it, would
ye?”</p>

<p>Tom laughed. “No,” he admitted, “but if
Dad took out all the inside of the house, and then took
off the boards and just left the old cellar, I’d call it
pretty near a new house, and that’s what we’re doing
with the <i>Narwhal</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot!” burst out the old whaleman,
to whom an old hull was almost sacred. “Ye’d find
a purty diff’runce in what ye’d have to pay if ye wuz
to build a new schooner ’stead o’ refittin’ this here
hooker.”</p>

<p>Then, when at last the hull and decks were done
and it came to rigging, dissension arose as to how
the <i>Narwhal</i> should be rigged. Mr. Dixon, who was
of the new school, wanted a three-masted schooner
and some of the other owners, a two-master, while
one old fellow insisted a bark was the only rig. But
the boys stoutly insisted that their ship, as they called
her, must be rigged as she was originally and they
were sustained by Mr. Nye, while old Cap’n Pem
vowed he’d not take the place as ice pilot unless she
was a square topsail schooner.</p>

<p>“If you take my advice,” said Mr. Chester, when
on one occasion he was discussing the matter with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boys and Mr. Nye, “you’ll put a motor in her. I
suppose it will be little less than heresy to suggest it
to the whalemen, but a motor will be a godsend in
the ice.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” assented Mr. Nye. “Whale-ships
have had auxiliary power before now and the <i>Narwhal</i>
can stand a motor. Yes, I think there’s no
question that a motor will prove a most valuable asset.
Why, even in towage it’ll save its own cost.”</p>

<p>But when Cap’n Pem heard of this he almost exploded.
“Consarn sech rattletrap contraptions!” he
exclaimed. “Ain’t sails an’ the win’ God gave us
good enough fer to take this here ship where we aim
fer to go? Motor! By cricky! do ye want fer to
make a ottymobil out o’ the ol’ <i>Narwhal</i>.”</p>

<p>“Shure thin’ an’ ’twill be a shofure yez’ll be afther
wantin’,” put in Mike. “An’ b’ the same token, ’tis
a foine motorneer Oi am meself. B’gorra ’tis a
shame to be a-turnin’ o’ the ould schooner into a
power boat, but handy ’twill be Oi do be thinkin’
manny the toime.”</p>

<p>But despite Pem’s protests and contempt and sarcastic
remarks, the motor was installed and Mike,
who really had had experience in handling motors in
the navy, was rated as engineer.</p>

<p>In regard to the rigging, Cap’n Pem and the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
had their way. Captain Edwards had agreed with
the old whaleman that a topsail schooner was the
handiest vessel to navigate in the ice; also he had
pointed out that, having been originally rigged as
such, it was cheaper and easier to re-rig the <i>Narwhal</i>
in the same way.</p>

<p>So the tall and tapering spars were set up, the long
and beautifully proportioned cross yards for the foremast
were slung, the standing rigging was bowsed
taut, served, and tarred; the huge blocks and the maze
of halyards, lifts, braces, sheets, lines and ropes were
rigged, and, resplendent in a coat of new paint, the
rejuvenated <i>Narwhal’s</i> motor was started and she
chugged slowly across the harbor to the New Bedford
dock.</p>

<p>“Now what do you think of her?” asked Tom of
old Mike as the staunch, trim schooner was warped
alongside the dock, and her lofty, golden-tinted spars
loomed high above the water-front buildings.</p>

<p>“Waall, b’gorra, ’tis not the same ship at all, at
all,” declared the Irishman. “Shure ’tis loike the
sailor’s knoife she do be—the same ould knoife,
barrin’ new blades an’ a new handle.”</p>

<p>“Gid out!” cried old Pem. “By heck, if ye got
a new timber leg I ’spec’ ye’d be a dod gasted new
man, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“No!” responded the Irishman. “But shure an’ if
Oi foun’ me a foine new hidpiece an’ a new body
an’ a new pair o’ han’s, the wooden lig o’ me remainin’
would niver be afther makin’ ould Moike out o’
the broth of a b’y Oi’d be.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care what you say, it’s the same old
<i>Narwhal</i>,” insisted Tom, “just as much as the <i>Hector</i>
was the same old <i>Hector</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yis, yis, so she do be,” agreed Mike. “An’
’tis a foine cruise we’ll be takin’ in her—an’ foine
luck we’ll be havin’ Oi’m thinkin’—phwat wid the
same ould crew o’ the <i>Hector</i>. An’ thanks be to
Hivvin there’ll be no bo’sun burrds for to be a-perchin’
on the yarrds an’ a-scarin’ the loife out of us
all.”</p>

<p>Even when the ship was reconditioned there was
much to be done. The boys had thought that the old
<i>Hector</i> had carried vast quantities of stores, but when
they saw the mountain of barrels, shooks, boxes,
cases and casks that were piled on the wharf, and
the steady stream of trucks and drays that kept adding
their loads to the accumulation, they declared that
the <i>Narwhal</i> would sink at the wharf if all the supplies
were stowed aboard her.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye fergit we’re a-goin’ for a long v’yage,”
Cap’n Pem reminded them. “Lord knows when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ol’ <i>Narwhal</i>’ll be a-pokin’ of her jib boom pas’ New
Bedford light ag’in. An’ there ain’t no delic’tessen
’roun’ the corner in the Ar’tic, by gum!”</p>

<p>“But what do they want all that salt for?”
asked Jim, who had been watching barrel after
barrel of coarse Turks’ Island salt being slung
aboard.</p>

<p>“Curin’ skins,” replied the old whaleman. “’Spect
we’ll be a-gittin’ a purty good cargo o’ seals. Ain’t
been hunted much fer a spell an’ pelts is purty high.
Yessir, better’n ile now’days.”</p>

<p>“And what do we need lumber for?” queried Tom.
“Any one would think we were going to build a house
up there.”</p>

<p>“So we be,” declared Pem. “Come winter an’
she freezes in, we’ll be a-makin’ on her shipshape an’
comfy for six months o’ everlastin’ night. House the
ol’ hooker in—didn’t ’spec’ ye could spen’ the winter
in that there mite of a cabin an’ the fo’c’s’le, did
ye?”</p>

<p>“Well, I see we’ve a lot to learn yet,” laughed
Tom. “What about guns and things for shooting the
seals and bears?”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem guffawed. “Lor’ love ye!” he exclaimed.
“They don’t scarcely never shoot seals—jes
knock ’em over the head same as we did them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
there sea el’phunts. But they’ll be guns aboard fer
huntin’ musk ox an’ reindeer an’ b’ars, an’ a lot o’
ol’ muskets fer to trade to the Eskimos.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re taking our own rifles,” said Jim,
“but I don’t see any heavy clothes or overcoats in
the stores.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t none,” declared the old whaleman. “Plenty
o’ warm woolens an’ mitts an’ sea boots an’ sou’westers
though. Don’ never take no overcoats along.
Jes git fur clothes from the Eskimos. They’re a
heap sight warmer an’ cheaper.”</p>

<p>So, with the boys constantly plying the old sailor
with questions, and daily learning more and more
about the outfitting and the coming cruise, the work
of loading and storing the pile of supplies went on,
until at last, to the boys’ amazement, the stevedores
and sailors managed to find a place for everything.</p>

<p>Finally the final package was aboard. The <i>Narwhal’s</i>
deck was littered, the cabin was choked with
boxes, half the galley was filled with coal, and even
the spare boats were filled with stores. Still the
<i>Narwhal</i> showed plenty of freeboard and rode buoyantly
on the water.</p>

<p>Then came trucks carrying huge rolls of new white
canvas, a crowd of men swarmed up the rigging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
over the yards, the great sails were bent on and
stretched. The <i>Narwhal</i> was ready to start on her
long cruise to the frozen north.</p>

<p>It only remained to get the crew together, and
when the two boys finally stepped on to the schooner’s
decks on the day of leaving, they felt as if they were
once more aboard the old <i>Hector</i>. There was Cap’n
Edwards, with his merry blue eyes, white hair and
leatherlike face. Cap’ Pem stumped back and forth
with a frown on his face and his old cap at a rakish
angle on his grizzled head. Mike was bawling orders
and punctuating quaint commands with his Irish
wit, and Mr. Kemp, longer and lankier than ever,
grinned at the boys with his mouth twisted by the
ghastly scar received when his ship was sunk by a
German U-boat. From the galley door, the ebony-faced
cook bobbed his woolly head in greeting, and,
with a mallet in one hand and wooden wedges in the
other, the dried-up, chin-whiskered Irish carpenter
was busy battening down hatches with the help of
big, raw-boned Ole Swanson, the cooper. Even one-eyed
Ned and deaf-and-dumb Pete were there, and
so the only faces the boys missed from the <i>Hector’s</i>
crew were those of the pop-eyed boy and the big
gorilla-like black sailor.</p>

<p>“Why, you got all the old men back!” cried Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
delightedly, as he recognized one after the other.
“Even Pete!”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem grinned. “Yep,” he replied, “that
there old fool Mike jes’ nat’rally did like ye told of
him. But, arter all, they ain’t sech an all-fired bad
lot o’ han’s, an’ they knows me and the skipper an’
Mr. Kemp, an’ ol’ shipmates is ol’ shipmates—spite
o’ their bein’ mos’ly derelic’s. An’ I reckon Pete’ll
be a sort o’ mascot—Eskimos is so dumb they allers
thinks dummies is big med’cine an’ is supe’stitious
’bout ’em. ’Sides, we had sech everlastin’ luck las’
v’yage, mebbe we’ll be lucky ’long o’ this, seein’s
we’ve got the hull crowd ag’in.”</p>

<p>As Cap’n Pem was speaking, the hawsers had been
cast off, Mike had started the motor and the screw
churned the water. The crowd gathered on the dock,
shouted farewells and good lucks and the boys sprang
to the taffrail, and waved and yelled good-by to their
parents. The <i>Narwhal</i>, gay with bunting, her big
sails hanging loosely in the buntlines and brails,
slipped into the stream, swung slowly about, and
under her own power was headed towards the harbor
mouth.</p>

<p>Once more to the boys’ ears came the rousing
chantey as the men piled aloft, scrambled out on
yards, and manned the halyards and hoists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The ship she’s a-sailing out over the bar,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Away Rio! Away Rio!</div>
<div class="verse">The ship she’s a-sailing out over the bar,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We’re bound for the Rio Grande!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus sang the men as the sails rose slowly, with
many a rattle and purl of blocks, and the <i>Narwhal’s</i>
white wings gleamed in the bright June sunshine.
The boys thrilled with pride and delight as they
glanced aloft at the tapering spars and taut rigging
and at the sheen of sails. As they felt the gentle
motion of the deck, Tom and Jim realized that they
were once more starting forth on adventures—and
this time in their own ship.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE BANKS</span></h2>

<p>Once past the lighthouse, and with a fair
wind, the <i>Narwhal’s</i> motor was stopped,
sheets and braces were trimmed, and, heeling
gently to her immense square foretop and foretopgallant
sails and the vast expanse of her fore
and mainsails the schooner plunged eastward.</p>

<p>“Golly, isn’t she a fine old ship!” cried Tom, as he
stepped to the lee rail and watched the hissing froth
speed past. “Why, she’s going like a yacht and
there’s not much wind either!”</p>

<p>“Used to was the fastest hooker ’round the
Cape,” rumbled Cap’n Pem.</p>

<p>“And spreads enough canvas to drive a clipper
ship,” added Captain Edwards, glancing at the straining
spars and rigging. “Pem, you’ll have to keep
a weather eye liftin’ an’ be ready to shorten sail at
the first sign of a blow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” agreed the other, “that there’s the
wust o’ these here torpsa’l schooners—too derned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
much canvas aloft. It’ll drive ’em like blazes in a
light win’, but keeps the crew everlastin’ly on the
jump a-reefin’ and short’nin’ sail. Reckon soon’s
ever we get no’thard o’ the Banks, we’d be a leedle
mite snugger if we housed that there to’gallant
sail.”</p>

<p>“Yes, better do that,” agreed the skipper, “we
won’t need it in the ice.”</p>

<p>Now that the boys had a chance to look about,
they noticed for the first time that there were no
swarthy-faced Portuguese among the crew.</p>

<p>“Never take ’em to the Arctic,” Mr. Kemp told
them in reply to their question. “Ain’t no good there—just
shiver and freeze like a lot of frozen turnips.”</p>

<p>“Is it really as cold as that?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Cold!” exclaimed the lanky second officer.
“Cold! Well, let me tell you a fellow doesn’t know
what cold is ’til he’s spent a winter froze in up
’round the North Pole.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been there?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp looked at Tom in surprise. “<em>Of</em>
course,” he declared. “Wish I had as many dollars
as I’ve put in days in the ice.”</p>

<p>“And did you ever shoot white bears, and walrus,
and musk oxen, and see Eskimos?” cried Jim.</p>

<p>“Did I?” grinned the officer. “Didn’t do much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
else durin’ the winter ’cept have shenannigans with
the Eskimos aboard.”</p>

<p>“Do they talk English?” asked Tom. “Or do you
have to know how to speak Eskimo?”</p>

<p>“Well, some of ’em talk what they <em>call</em> English,”
said Mr. Kemp. “Those are the fellows that’s been
whalin’ long of Yankee and Scotch ships, but the
most of ’em just palaver in their own lingo—and I
can talk that. I was brung up with a Eskimo kid,
and learnt it from him.”</p>

<p>“Why, how was that?” asked Jim, “I thought
you came from right here on Cape Cod.”</p>

<p>“Nope, Noank, back in Connecticut,” said the
other. “And there was a Eskimo there—Eskimo Joe
they called him—what had a kid ’bout my age.
We went to school together and was reg’lar
chums.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there were any Eskimos in Connecticut,”
exclaimed Tom. “I thought they always
died when they came down here.”</p>

<p>“Joe didn’t,” the other assured him. “And say,
he could have told you a bully good yarn. I don’t
know as I can spin the whole of it for you, but he
an’ his squaw come down on a cake of ice. That
is, they come most o’ the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell us about it!” cried Tom. “How did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
he happen to be on a cake of ice and how could he
come down on it?”</p>

<p>“Well, there don’t seem to be much to do right
now, so I expect I <em>can</em> spare a couple o’ minutes to
tell you,” agreed Mr. Kemp. “Especially,” he
added with a grin, “as long as the owners is tellin’
me to.”</p>

<p>“You see,” he began, seating himself on a coil of
rope and lighting his pipe, “Eskimo Joe was one o’
the hunters an’ pilots on the old <i>Polaris</i>—a ship what
was up huntin’ for the North Pole long afore my
time—back in 1871 ’twas. Well, the <i>Polaris</i> got
froze in hard an’ fast, and the crew, thinkin’ she
might get stove, put most of the stuff on the ice and
was gettin’ ready for a bust up. But it come afore
they expected of it. Ice broke up and left some of
the folks on the ice ’longside the ship and the rest
of ’em on a big piece of floe adrift in the water.
Eskimo Joe was with that crowd along with his squaw
and Captain Tyson of the <i>Polaris</i> and a bunch o’
men—twenty there was all told—and nary a mite
of food.</p>

<p>“Just as soon as the ice got adrift it commenced
to travel in a current, and there they was, driftin’
about on an ice island that might go to bits or capsize
any minute. Times was when they pretty near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
starved, but they caught gulls and murres and auks
and other birds, and Joe fixed up a fishin’ tackle
and got fish now and then. Sometimes, too, a seal
would come aboard the cake and Joe’d get him;
and once a white bear clumb on to the ice and Joe
nailed him, too. I don’t guess bear’s any too good
meat, but it sure was welcome to those folks. Well,
to make a long story short, they was driftin’ on that
ice cake for six months, yes, sir and the cake gettin’
smaller all the time as it drifted along south. Then,
along in April ’72 a sealin’ ship—steamer, <i>Tigress</i>,
o’ St. John’s, Newfoundland ’twas—hove in sight
and picked ’em up, and every man jack o’ the twenty-one
safe and hearty.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you said there were only twenty!”
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp grinned. “So I did and so there was,”
he declared, “when they went adrift. But you see,
while they was navigatin’ ’round on their ice island,
Joe’s squaw had a baby an’ that was the kid I used
to be chums with.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope we don’t get adrift like that!” exclaimed
Jim. “But it must have been some adventure!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t never tell,” remarked Mr. Kemp
as he rose and hurried off. “But I guess after bein’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sunk by a sub, driftin’ on a ice floe wouldn’t be so
bad as it might be.”</p>

<p>The Elizabeth Islands were now close ahead, and
the <i>Narwhal</i> was soon passing through the narrow
channel between Naushon and Woods Hole and, to
the south, Martha’s Vineyard was in plain sight.
With every stitch of canvas set, the schooner sped on
across Nantucket Sound towards distant Monomoy
Light.</p>

<p>It was a perfect June day, warm and bright, and
with a steady northwest wind on the <i>Narwhal’s</i> quarter.
Captain Edwards declared that if the breeze
held throughout the day and night, they would pass
George’s Banks before noon the following day. Before
dark, long, low Monomoy Point was sighted and
with the last of the land astern, Cap’n Pem roared
out orders and the willing crew raced to sheets and
braces.</p>

<div class="verse indent1">Oh, whisky for my Johnny!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lustily the men roared out the old chantey as
the fore and mainsail sheets were hauled in, and the
big foretopsail yard swung to the heave of the braces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Then, as the <i>Narwhal</i> turned towards the north and
the freshening wind abeam buried her lee rails under
the tumbling suds-like froth, the crew swarmed aloft.
Presently the foretopgallant sail was thrashing and
snapping like a battery of rapid-fire guns, as the
men furled the canvas to the rousing chantey:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The schooner headed across the broad Atlantic,
and darkness fell upon the sea. Monomoy Light was
but a tiny twinkling star astern, and the boys felt
their cruise had really begun.</p>

<p>The next morning was fair but almost calm. As
the boys came on deck, they were surprised to see a
score and more of trim schooners riding easily on
the long ocean swell under light canvas.</p>

<p>“It must be a yacht club!” exclaimed Tom, “but
I didn’t know they came so far to sea.”</p>

<p>“Fishing fleet from Gloucester,” said Captain Edwards,
who heard Tom’s remark. “We’re passing
George’s Banks. Don’t you see the dories yonder?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I do now,” declared Tom. “But why do
they call it a Bank? I don’t see any land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Waall, I swan!” cried Cap’n Pem. “To think o’
ye young scallawags a-bein’ navigators an’ owners o’
a torps’l schooner, and a-havin’ v’y’ged to the Sou’
Shetland’s, an’ not a-knowin’ on a fishin’ smack when
ye sees ’em, nor a-knowin’ nothin’ ’bout the Banks.
Lor’ love ye, there beint no lan’ here ’bouts ’ceptin’
straight down. Ye see the Banks is ’bout a hundred
fathom deep, an’ that’s plumb shaller fer mid-ocean,
so they calls on ’em Banks. Ain’t no ’cause to be
skeert o’ runnin’ the ol’ <i>Narwhal</i> agroun’!”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we <em>are</em> awfully green,” laughed
Tom, “but they never told us that in school when
we learned about the ocean and the coast in physical
geography, and I thought fishing schooners were
dirty old boats.”</p>

<p>“Finest little ships afloat,” declared the skipper.
“And just as fast as they can be built. Have to be
to get the catch to market—price depends on the
first to make port. Look there! There goes one of
’em now. She’s got a full catch an’s beatin’ it for
Boston.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed to one of the schooners
that had run a flag to her maintopmast head. As
the boys looked, the schooner blossomed into a perfect
cloud of snowy canvas.</p>

<p>“Gosh, look at her go!” cried Jim delightedly, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the trim black schooner heeled towards them until
they could see the full sweep of her deck. With a
mountain of foam about her bows, she fairly raced
through the oily sea.</p>

<p>“And hardly enough wind to fill our sails,” added
Tom. “Say, I wish the <i>Narwhal</i> could go like
that!”</p>

<p>“And there goes another and another!” cried Jim.
“Golly, it’s like a race.”</p>

<p>“So ’tis a race,” chuckled the captain. “With
thousands of dollars to the winner.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy, I’d like to sail on those boats,” declared
Tom as the schooners swept by with a hiss and roar.
“It must be exciting.”</p>

<p>“Pesky hard work if ye asks me,” declared Cap’n
Pem. “An’ no fun, come winter, I tell ye. By
gum, I’d ruther be froze up in the Ar’tic.”</p>

<p>“And plenty of danger too,” added the skipper.
“Hardly a week passes that fishermen are not lost
on the Banks—though it’s on the Grand Banks more
than here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what’s dangerous about it,” said Tom
as they turned to go to breakfast. “Just coming
out here in a fine schooner and fishing.”</p>

<p>“There’s not—on a day like this,” agreed Captain
Edwards, “but in fog, the schooners or dories are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
often run down by steamers; the dories get parted
from their ships and are lost, and in winter storms
they are often swamped or driven to sea by gales.
I tell you, boys, if you want to read exciting stories
of heroism and hardship, just get the Gloucester
papers and read ’em. Why, it’s worse than whalin’—almost.”</p>

<p>By the time breakfast was over, the fishing fleet
was a mere group of flashing white specks astern,
and the boats which had raced to port were out of
sight.</p>

<p>Presently Cap’n Pem called Mr. Kemp and suggested
that it was a good day to break in the green
hands. For several hours the boys were amused
by watching the frightened men, who had never before
been to sea, as they were compelled to go aloft.
It was a familiar sight to them for they had seen it
day after day on the <i>Hector</i> but they could not help
being sorry for the fellows, as the two whalemen
forced the men into the rigging.</p>

<p>There was no actual brutality—although, judging
from the words and looks of Cap’n Pem and the
second mate, the men might well have thought they
were ready to do murder if they were not obeyed.
After a bit, the green hands were allowed to come
down, the big yards were swung, the schooner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hove to, and for several hours the “greenies” were
put through a grilling boat practice. This they thoroughly
enjoyed, and they chaffed and jollied one another
whenever they caught a crab with the huge
ash oars, or made some similar breaks that brought
down a fiery string of comments from the officers.
But there was not a great deal of this drilling and
breaking in, for the <i>Narwhal’s</i> crew was small and
only a very few of the men were raw hands, the
captain explaining that the bulk of the work on the
“grounds” would be done by the Eskimos who
could be taken aboard at Labrador or Greenland.</p>

<p>“Gee, it sounds funny to be talking about going
to Greenland!” laughed Tom. “I can’t really believe
it yet. How long should it take us to get there,
Captain Edwards?”</p>

<p>“Impossible to say,” replied the skipper. “Depends
on wind and fog and how much ice we find
when we get to the Straits.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there—there she blows!” shouted Jim. “Off
the port bow!”</p>

<p>Instantly all eyes were turned in the direction
Jim indicated, and Mr. Kemp raced up the rigging.
The next moment a dozen little fountains of spray
rose above the green surface of the sea, and a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the huge black bodies rolled sluggishly into
view.</p>

<p>“Blackfish!” shouted Mr. Kemp.</p>

<p>“So they be!” echoed Cap’n Pem. “Don’t ye
youngsters know whales yit?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they whales?” demanded Tom. “They
look like ’em to me.”</p>

<p>“No, blackfish-grampus,” declared the skipper.
“But after all, they <em>are</em> a kind of whale.” Then,
after a moment, he exclaimed. “Pem, let’s lower
away and go after ’em. Good practice for the men,
an’ blackfish ile’s worth takin’. There ain’t no wind
an’ we won’t lose ’nough time to count.”</p>

<p>“Stan’ by to lower away the sta’board boats,”
roared the old whaleman.</p>

<p>Then, as the yards were swung and the schooner
came to a standstill, the boats were lowered, the men
tumbled in, and to the pull of the six long ash oars
in each, they went racing towards the school of blackfish.</p>

<p>To the boys’ delight, they were allowed to go after
the grampus, for they had always longed to go in one
of the boats as it dashed across the waves after a
whale. To be sure “going on” the blackfish was not
the same as attacking a monster cetacean. But it
was the nearest thing to it, and both Tom and Jim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
thrilled with excitement as the ash oars bent to the
brawny muscles of the men, and the keen-stemmed
boat fairly leaped through the water.</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem was as excited as if he were after a
real whale. Standing at the huge steering oar, with
his hair flying, he shouted to the straining crew.</p>

<p>“Lift her, lads!” he cried. “Get in on the pesky
critters! Don’t let that there swab o’ a secon’ mate
git fust! Git arter ’em, ye lubbers!”</p>

<p>Forward the harpoonier or boat-steerer laid aside
his oar and unsheathed a keen-pointed harpoon or
“iron,” a lighter weapon than the one the boys had
seen used for sperm whales. Bracing his knee in
the clumsy cleat, he stood ready to strike the blackfish
that were now but a few hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>Close behind came Mr. Kemp’s boat, his crew
striving their utmost to reach the grampus in time to
make a strike before the fish were frightened. Almost
side by side the two boats swept upon the unsuspecting
creatures.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the boat crept. The boat
steerer raised his weapon, braced himself, every
muscle taut, and was on the point of heaving the
iron at a huge grampus a few yards ahead when
Tom let out a terrified yell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Within a few feet of the boat a huge, triangular
fin had cut through the water and the next instant
an immense body hurled itself into the air and, with
a sweep of its stupendous tail, struck the water with
a blow like a bursting shell, drenching the occupants
of the boat.</p>

<p>“Thrasher!” shouted Cap’n Pem.</p>

<p>The harpoonier picked himself up from where he
had stumbled, as the deluge of water almost drowned
him. He poised his iron and glanced about. Not
a grampus was in sight.</p>

<p>“Dern his everlastin’ hide!” yelled Cap’n Pem.
“Look out! There, he’s a-comin’! Strike him,
Nat!”</p>

<p>As the old whaleman spoke, the big fin again ripped
through the sea and with a grunt the boat-steerer
heaved his long weapon. The next second the water
was lashed into foam, the heavy manilla whale line
was rushing through the chocks like a streak of light,
and the heavy boat was tearing through the sea at
express-train speed.</p>

<p>“Fast!” screamed Cap’n Pem, as he tugged and
strained at his big oar.</p>

<p>Then, “Breachin’!” he cried, as once more the
immense creature flung itself clear of the water.
The boys, dazed, frightened, and gasping, saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it was a gigantic shark with an enormously long tail.</p>

<p>Hardly had the thrasher struck the water again
when the line ran out a few feet. Suddenly it grew
slack and the boat came to a standstill.</p>

<p>“Drew!” exclaimed Cap’n Pem. “Consarn it,
reckon we might’s well go back. Nary mite o’ use
a-tryin’ fer them blackfish now.”</p>

<p>Crestfallen, the men took to the oars and started
to pull back to the ship.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> a thrasher?” asked Tom, now that the
excitement was over.</p>

<p>“Kind o’ shark,” replied Cap’n Pem. “Biggest
nuisance ever was. Jes rush in an’ thresh about and
kill a lot o’ fish, and then gobbles of ’em up. That
there consarn rascal was after them blackfish,
though.”</p>

<p>“Whew, do they kill—Oh, look, Mr. Kemp’s
boat’s fast!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the second mate’s boat was rushing
through the sea evidently towed by some creature,
and a few moments later the boys saw the officer
stand erect in the bow, poise his lance and lunge forward
with it.</p>

<p>“Reckon we might jes as well pull over thataway
an’ mebbe get a chanct to strike,” remarked Cap’n
Pem, swinging the boat’s head as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes they were within hailing distance
of the second mate’s boat.</p>

<p>“Did you get one?” yelled Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” shouted back Mr. Kemp. “Come
over here and bear a hand to tow this critter to the
schooner.”</p>

<p>“Waall I’ll be sunk!” cried Cap’n Pem. “What’s
the matter with thet there crew o’ yourn? Ain’t they
got beef ’nough for to tow in a consarned leedle blackfish?”</p>

<p>The boats were now close together and the boys
saw a huge black body rolling in the swell beyond
the second mate’s boat.</p>

<p>“Blackfish?” yelled Mr. Kemp. “You’re a fine
whaleman! What’s the matter with your eyes, Pem?”</p>

<p>But the old whaleman had now caught sight of
the other boat’s kill and the expression that came
over his weather-beaten old face was so ludicrous
that the boys roared. His eyes seemed popping from
their sockets, his mouth gaped and he looked as if
he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>“By the great red herrin’!” he ejaculated at last.
“I’ll be everlastin’ly keelauled if ’tain’t a whale!
An’ sparm at thet!”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">A CLOSE SHAVE</span></h2>

<p>“I told you they were whales!” exclaimed Tom
triumphantly, as the two boats drew side by
side, and the men busied themselves getting
tow lines fast to the dead whale.</p>

<p>“They wasn’t,” declared Cap’n Pem, “jes or’nary
blackfish.”</p>

<p>“But this is a whale,” argued Tom.</p>

<p>“Jes dumb luck o’ Mr. Kemp,” replied the old
whaleman. “Jes happened to be ’long o’ them there
grampuses. An’ ’tain’t much o’ a whale neither—jes
a baby.”</p>

<p>“Well it’s just our luck to be in the boat that didn’t
get the whale,” lamented Jim. “Did you have much
of a tussle, Mr. Kemp?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ worth while,” responded the second officer.
“Towed us a bit and died with nary a flurry.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they had sperm whales ’way up
here,” said Tom, as the crews bent to their oars with
the whale in tow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t, so everlastin’ly often,” Cap’n Pem told
him. “Come warm weather, they swims in by the
Banks now an’ ag’in—that is, sparm do—an’ times
gone there used to was a powerful lot o’ Biscay
whales ’roun’ about the New Englan’ coast. Yes,
sir, I recollec’ when a ship could v’yage out o’ New
Bedford or Nantucket an’ fill up with Biscay ile
an’ bone inside o’ six weeks.”</p>

<p>The schooner had now caught a light wind and
was bearing down upon the boats. A few moments
later, the whale was alongside and the two boats
had been hoisted to the davits. Then followed the
dirty, busy work of cutting in and boiling, with all
of which the boys were familiar from their cruise in
the Antarctic. But the whale, as Cap’n Pem had
said, was scarcely more than a baby. The work was
all over before midnight, with twenty barrels of oil
stowed in the schooner’s hold.</p>

<p>“Pretty good beginning—for three days out of
port,” chuckled Captain Edwards. “I reckon you
boys—ahem, owners—must be mascots. Just hope
the luck holds all through.”</p>

<p>“Well, there won’t be any bo’sun birds to bring
bad luck, anyway,” laughed Jim. “Although I suppose
there must be some bad omen even up here or
sailors wouldn’t be satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Plenty on ’em,” declared Cap’n Pem. “But don’t
go to talkin’ an’ a-bringin’ o’ it on. Ain’t it bad
’nough to have that there black cat aboard—an’ nary
a dod-gasted soul a-knowin’ where she come from?”</p>

<p>The boys roared. “I knew you’d find something,”
cried Tom. “Why, I thought the cat belonged to the
crew. Why don’t you kill her or something if she’s
such bad luck?”</p>

<p>“Kill her!” exclaimed the old man. “By the eternal,
don’t ye know no more’n thet? Ye mought jes
as well kill a Mother Cary’s chicken or a bo’sun bird.
No sirree! Let good enough alone’s my motter.”</p>

<p>“Well, you <em>are</em> the most superstitious old whaleman
I ever saw,” laughed Tom. “I’ll bet the cat’s
what brought the good luck.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem snorted. “Ye mark my words,” he
muttered as he strode aft. “We’ll be gittin’ inter
some sort o’ mess long o’ that there cat yit.”</p>

<p>But for the next three or four days none on the
<i>Narwhal</i> could have asked for better weather. The
breeze, though light, was fair and steady. The sea
ran in long, easy swells and the schooner, curtseying
gently and with every stitch of canvas set, pressed
steadily on her course.</p>

<p>Then one night the boys were awakened by the
tolling of a bell and the ear-splitting screech of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
horn. Hastily throwing on a few clothes, they hurried
on deck.</p>

<p>At the first glance about they realized what the
trouble was. The man at the wheel was barely visible,
although less than a dozen feet distant. The
faint light of the binnacle was a mere glow and the
sails, spars, and forward part of the vessel melted
into nothingness. The <i>Narwhal</i> was enveloped in a
dense fog.</p>

<p>From the unseen bows of the ship came the monotonous
tolling of the bell. At intervals the raucous
horn screeched from the blanket of gray mist. Borne
in strangely ghostly fashion from the blackness, came
the voices of men.</p>

<p>Tom glanced at his watch and found that it was
nearly sunrise but nowhere was there a hint of light
or of dawn.</p>

<p>“Gosh, but it’s thick!” exclaimed Tom. “I wonder
where we are.”</p>

<p>“Where I wish we wasn’t,” replied a voice so
close to the boys that they jumped. “Right plumb
on the Grand Banks,” continued the invisible speaker,
whom the boys now recognized as Captain Edwards.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with the Banks?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong with them,” replied the skipper
who now stepped from the curtain of fog and stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
near the boys. “But Lord alone knows when we may
be a-knockin’ into a fishin’ smack, or a-bearin’ down
on a dory, or gettin’ run down by a liner. I wish to
heaven this condemned fog would lift.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he ceased speaking when there was a
hoarse shout from forward, a tearing, grating sound,
and a vast dark mass loomed alongside as the <i>Narwhal</i>
scraped past a fishing schooner, snapping off
the smack’s jib boom. A moment later the stranger
was lost in the fog and only faint, angry cries
told of her whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Sarved the lubbers right!” exploded Cap’n Pem,
as he came hurrying aft to see if the <i>Narwhal</i> had
been injured. “Never a-blowin’ o’ nary a horn, nor
a-ringin’ o’ their bell!”</p>

<p>“Did it hurt us any?” asked Tom excitedly.</p>

<p>“Carried away a couple of backstays,” replied the
skipper. “Lucky we was both headed the same
way.”</p>

<p>By now the fog was getting lighter with the rising
sun. The boys could see the lower portions of the
sails, the lower masts, the ship’s deck as far forward
as the forerigging, and the dull gray-green sea
for a few hundred feet about the schooner. Beyond
that, all was a solid wall of gray through which
the <i>Narwhal</i> forged slowly ahead, horn and bell constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sounding warnings, and with men aloft striving
to peer into the impenetrable murk.</p>

<p>“I should think they’d stop and anchor, or heave to
until it lifts,” remarked Jim.</p>

<p>“Better to keep movin’,” declared Mr. Kemp, who
was peering first to one side and then the other.
“Long as we’ve steerage way on, we’ve a chance to
dodge another ship—if we see ’em in time.”</p>

<p>Presently, from the starboard, came the sound of a
bell. Then from ahead came the muffled roar of a
horn, and soon, from all directions, there were warnings
issuing from the fog.</p>

<p>“Golly, there are boats all around us!” cried Tom.
“Look! See there, Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim turned in time to see a ghostly phantomlike
shape appear as if by magic—a schooner with all
sails set, and seemingly within a dozen yards of the
<i>Narwhal</i>. But almost before he could grasp the
fact that it was a vessel, it had vanished as weirdly
as it had appeared.</p>

<p>For an hour or more the schooner picked her way
through the fog, often swinging sharply to port or
starboard at the skipper’s hoarsely bellowed orders,
a dozen times avoiding collision with a smack by a
few feet and twice swerving just in time to avoid
running down the tiny bobbing dories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the bells and horns grew faint. The captain
breathed more freely and declared he must
have left the fleet astern. As the fog began to lift
and a wider expanse of sea and the upper sails became
visible, the boys decided all danger was over
and prepared to go to the cabin and dress properly.</p>

<p>Then, from the lookout, a frightened yell rang
out. A shrieking bellow roared from the fog ahead.
With a bound Captain Edwards leaped to the wheel.
“Hard aport!” he screamed, as he grasped the spokes
and strained with the steersman at the helm.
Startled, realizing that imminent unknown peril
threatened, confused by the shouts, orders and rush
of men, the boys stood gazing helplessly about.</p>

<p>Then once more that ear-splitting, terrific bellow
thundered from the fog. As the <i>Narwhal’s</i> head
swung slowly to starboard, a vast, towering, mountainous
shape came tearing, rushing, through the fog.
Dimly through the opaque gray mist, the terror-stricken
boys saw the tremendous fabric bearing down
upon them. Far above the schooner’s crosstrees
reared the lofty stem of a gigantic steamship. Within
a cable’s length of the <i>Narwhal</i>, the billowing mass
of foam about the keen steel stem roared with the
sound of surf. Each second the boys expected to
hear the crashing blow, to feel the splintering, terrific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
impact that would spell their doom. Paralyzed with
fright, they stood motionless and speechless. Nothing,
they felt, could save them. The great, shearing
prow of the steamer seemed to overhang their heads.
Their staring eyes glimpsed dim, tiny figures leaning
over the rails far above, shouting, gesticulating, life
rings in hand.</p>

<p>And then, with a hissing roar like a passing train,
the huge liner swept by. Endless rows of port holes
filled with white faces rushed past the terror-stricken
boys. The next second the <i>Narwhal</i> was bobbing
and jumping like a cork on the tumbling heaving
wake, with only the pall of smoke and the churning
foam to mark the liner’s passage.</p>

<p>Leaping upon the schooner’s wildly tossing taffrail,
Captain Edwards shook his fist at the spot where
the liner had disappeared in the fog. Cap’n Pem,
unable to stand on the rail, seized a belaying pin,
hurled it after the liner and, throwing his cap on the
deck, fairly danced with rage.</p>

<p>“Consarn their everlastin’ hides!” he screamed.
“A-tearin’ ’crost these here Banks like a house afire,
an’ fog thicker’n cheese. Blasted murderers!
A-riskin’ lives o’ honest sailor men jes fer to make
time an’ save a few dirty, blasted dollars! I’d like
to git at ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite the narrow escape, the seriousness of the
situation, and the old whaleman’s earnestness, the
boys could not suppress a grin at the old fellow’s
towering and thoroughly justified rage at the reckless
officers of the liner.</p>

<p>Then, as if the steamship’s passage had been the
signal, the fog lifted rapidly. A fresh breeze came
up and presently the <i>Narwhal</i> was speeding over a
wide clear sea with only a few wisps of whitish vapor
to mark the fog which had so nearly brought an end
to the schooner and those upon her.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell ye that there black cat would a be
bringin’ o’ bad luck!” cried Cap’n Pem, as his temper
cooled down and the fog disappeared.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed Tom. “She brought good
luck three times now—first the whale, then escaping
from that schooner, and then being saved from the
steamer. And I shouldn’t wonder if she made the
fog lift, too.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” snorted the old man. “’Course ye’ll
have it your way, but if she didn’t bring that there
fog an’ that consarned pesky liner, what did?”</p>

<p>“And if she didn’t save us and make the fog clear,
what did?” responded Jim.</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem pursed his mouth, jerked his cap
down over his eyes and stumped off. “No use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
argufyin’,” he declared. “But ye’ll see! Mark my
words.”</p>

<p>Three days after their narrow escape from the liner,
the boys saw Cape Breton light. Tacking in long
reaches, the <i>Narwhal</i> worked across the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, and with the thrill of seeing strange lands,
Tom and Jim stared through their glasses at the forbidding
shores of Newfoundland and at bleak Anticosti.</p>

<p>It was slow, hard work beating against tides, currents
and head winds. Late in the season though it
was, masses of ice still lingered in the coves of the
shores. Once, as they watched the dirty white
masses of ice, Tom cried out in delight as he saw a
number of sleek brown creatures scramble into the
sea when the schooner approached.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, those were seals!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yep, harbor seal,” said Captain Edwards. “Not
worth much. But you’ll see a-plenty of real seals
after a bit. Shouldn’t wonder if we’d get some hides
up round Belle Isle. Never did see so pesky much
ice in the Gulf this time o’ year.”</p>

<p>At last the Straits of Belle Isle were reached, the
wind shifted and once more sailing free, the <i>Narwhal</i>
made good time through the narrow waterway between
Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>As they passed the lonely, wave-washed Belle Isle,
men were sent aloft on the lookout for seals. Nothing
but a few herds of the little harbor seals were
seen, however, and these were so wary that Captain
Edwards vowed it would be a waste of time to attempt
to hunt them.</p>

<p>Then, swinging past Cape St. Lewis, the schooner
was headed up the coast of Labrador for Hebron
where she was to put in for Eskimos.</p>

<p>Two days after passing the Cape, the boys were
scanning the ugly green sea with their glasses when a
faint, shimmering, cloud-like shape rose upon the
horizon.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a ship!” exclaimed Jim. “And a
big one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp looked up, shaded his eyes with his
hand and stared in the direction Jim indicated.
“Ship!” he exclaimed. “That’s a berg.”</p>

<p>“A berg!” cried Tom. “You mean an iceberg?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied the second mate. “Pretty sizeable
one too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s sail over and see it!” exclaimed
Jim.</p>

<p>“Less we see of ’em the better it’ll suit me,” said
the skipper who had been studying the berg. “But
you’ll have a chance to see it all right. We’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to go out of our course if we don’t want to bump
plumb into it.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the berg rose before the schooner, a massive
mountain of ice, its summit carved and melted
into spires, pinnacles and huge, overhanging shelves,
steep precipitous sides rising from the wide hummocky
base just above the waves and gleaming and
shimmering with every color of the rainbow.</p>

<p>“Gee, isn’t it pretty!” cried Jim. “I never knew
ice was so many colors. And look at those big
caves in the sides.”</p>

<p>“And look—oh look, Jim!” exclaimed Tom.
“There’s some one on it! See, right in front of that
big green cave!”</p>

<p>“What in tarnation ye talkin’ of?” demanded
Cap’n Pem. “Here, gimme them glasses.”</p>

<p>Adjusting the glasses, the old whaleman stared
fixedly for a moment at the distant iceberg. “Some
one on it!” he exclaimed. “Waal, I’ll be blowed if
there beint—but ’tain’t no human critter. That
there’s a whoppin’ big b’ar!”</p>

<p>“A bear?” cried Tom. “Hurrah! that’s all the
better. Oh say, Captain Edwards, can’t we go over
and shoot him?”</p>

<p>“Hmm,” muttered the skipper, “I dunno, but I
reckon you can. Pem, soon’s ever we get ’bout half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a mile from the berg, have the yards swung an’
lower the sta’board quarter boat. White bear skins
is worth takin’ and it’ll give the boys—I mean owners—a
chance to try their hands. Better let Mr. Kemp
go along with ’em.” Then, turning to the boys, he
continued. “Now mind you do just as Mr. Kemp
tells you. Bergs is mighty pesky things, an’ a gun
shot’s li’ble to start a break or a slide or topple the
dumb thing clean over. Better to lose the bear than
get kilt.”</p>

<p>The boys scarcely heard what he said. Filled with
excitement at thoughts of visiting the berg and shooting
a polar bear, they dashed to their cabin, hastily
got out their rifles and, stuffing their pockets with cartridges,
rushed back on deck.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE ICEBERG</span></h2>

<p>Within half a mile of the berg, the <i>Narwhal</i>
was hove to and lay resting motionless,
gently rising and falling to the
swell. Towering like a mountain peak, the mass of
ice shimmered and scintillated like a gigantic gem
against the sky.</p>

<p>Rapidly the boat sped towards the ice; and the
boys shivered and buttoned their coats and turned up
their collars as they drew near the immense ice mountain
that chilled the air for a mile or more.</p>

<p>The bear still squatted upon a hummock in front
of the deep green cavern in the side of the berg.
As they drew close and the men rowed more slowly,
the two boys crept to the bow of the boat and loaded
their rifles. Nearer and nearer they came. The
air was like the interior of a refrigerator. Still the
huge white bear sat motionless, as if awaiting the
boat, and wondering why he was to receive visitors
on his drifting ice home.</p>

<p>Now a scant one hundred yards of open water lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
between the boat and the berg. In low tones, Mr.
Kemp ordered the men to cease rowing and as the
boat lost headway, he spoke to the excited boys.
“Aim for his breast and shoot,” he said. “He’s a
fair mark and you ought to get him first crack.”</p>

<p>Kneeling in the bow of the boat, Tom and Jim
rested their rifles on the gunwale, took steady aim,
and pulled triggers. At the dual report a shower of
ice splinters flew up from beside the bear. The big
creature reared up on his hind legs, roared out a
growl that echoed from the cavern behind him,
pawed wildly at the air and toppled backwards out of
sight.</p>

<p>“Got him,” shouted Mr. Kemp. “Give way,
lads!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Jim. “Gee, won’t he make a
fine skin for a trophy. Say, I wonder which of us hit
him.”</p>

<p>“We can tell when we get him,” replied Tom.
“One of us missed and hit the ice; but your rifle’s a
.30-.30 and mine’s a .45 so we can tell by the bullet
hole in him.”</p>

<p>A moment later the boat grated on the shelving ice.
The boys leaped on to the berg, and Jim, being the
first to land, rushed up the rough hummocky ice towards
where the bear had fallen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>As he reached the spot where the bear had stood, he
uttered a terrified yell, leaped back, slipped on the
ice and came rolling and tumbling down the slope towards
Tom. Rearing gigantic at the summit of the
ridge was the bear, his lips drawn back over his huge
white teeth, blood dribbling from his mouth, his long
neck stretched out, and his wicked-looking head swaying
from side to side.</p>

<p>Instantly Tom threw his rifle to his shoulder and
took hasty aim at the bear’s breast.</p>

<p>“Hey, look out!” yelled Mr. Kemp. “Don’t——”</p>

<p>But his warning was too late. The roar of the
rifle cut his words short. There was a stunning, rending,
thunderous crash, the solid ice reeled and tossed
like the deck of a ship in a heavy sea, and the boys
and Mr. Kemp staggered drunkenly and fell sprawling.</p>

<p>“Wha—what happened?” cried Jim picking himself
up with a dazed expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Berg’s goin’ to pieces!” yelled the second officer.
“Come on back to the boat! That shot started the
darned ice to slippin’! It’s rotten as punk. Come
on, the whole blamed thing’s likely to go any minute!”</p>

<p>“But, but, where’s the bear?” gasped Tom, still
unable to fully grasp what had occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blast the bear!” ejaculated the second mate. “Get
a move on!”</p>

<p>Urging the boys forward, Mr. Kemp rushed down
the slope. As the boat drew in to the edge of the
ice, the three scrambled aboard.</p>

<p>“Lift her, lads!” cried the excited officer as the
boat shoved off, and the men bent to the long ash oars
with a will. Hardly had they cleared the berg when
there was a terrific, ripping, splintering roar. The
overhanging summit of the berg moved bodily forward,
hesitated an instant and then, with the deafening
roar of thunder, came plunging, crashing down
upon the spot where the three had been but a few moments
before.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Tom. “Gosh! I’m glad we
got away.”</p>

<p>“Gee Whitaker! yes,” cried Jim. “That old bear
must be squashed flat as a pancake.”</p>

<p>Everywhere about the berg, huge detached masses
of ice were floating, bobbing and turning and twisting
about. Constantly more and more of the ice
mountain was crashing down to the berg’s base, falling
with prodigious splashes into the sea. Once
started by the reverberations of Tom’s shot, the berg,
softened, full of holes, and rotten, was going to pieces
before the boys’ wondering eyes. It was a marvelous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fascinating, awe-inspiring sight to see the huge avalanches
of gleaming ice, the jewel-tinted spires, the
needlelike pinnacles, and the great overhanging precipices
rending and tumbling. And as each mass
dashed itself to pieces upon the base of the berg, or
plunged into the waves, sending great mountains of
spray into the air, the vibrations and shock of the
blow loosened other masses. Then, as those in
the boat gazed upon the dissolution of the mighty
berg, Tom uttered an excited cry.</p>

<p>“Look!” he yelled. “The berg’s moving!”</p>

<p>It was true. The towering summit of the iceberg
was swaying. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, it
swung to one side. More and more it leaned and
then, with a sudden rush, the mountain of ice toppled
over. Vast billows of green sea rose high and, with
the noise of a mighty cataract, the berg capsized.
Where the sharp, sky-piercing berg had loomed, only
a low hummocky stretch of ice tossed and heaved
upon the waves.</p>

<p>The boys, overwhelmed with the wondrous spectacle,
clung to the boat’s gunwales as the tiny craft
bobbed and rocked on the great combers from the
berg’s final plunge.</p>

<p>“Whew!” cried Jim when at last the seas subsided
and the men pulled towards the schooner. “Wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that a sight though? Say, that <em>was</em> worth seeing.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” agreed Tom. “But just the same I’m
mighty sorry we lost that bear.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp grinned. “You ought to be glad you
didn’t lose your own hides,” he declared. “I never
seen a berg so plumb rotten or go to pieces so blessed
fast.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy, I’d hate to be drifting south on one the
way Eskimo Joe did,” said Tom, “if that’s the way
they act.”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be no picnic,” agreed Mr. Kemp, “but
even a berg’s a heap better’n nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven you’re all safe!” cried Captain
Edwards as the boat reached the <i>Narwhal’s</i> side.
“When I saw that first slip, I thought ’twas all over
with you.”</p>

<p>“Waall, I reckon a miss’s good as a mile,” commented
Cap’n Pem. “But I swan, if you two young
scallawags ain’t everlastin’ly gittin’ inter more close
shaves than ever I heerd of afore.”</p>

<p>Tom winked at the skipper. “I suppose the black
cat started that!” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Drat that there cat!” cried the old whaleman
petulantly. “Jes the same I wish t’ blazes she was
a-settin’ over to that there berg ’stead o’ on this here
ship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>For several days after the boys’ adventure on the
iceberg the <i>Narwhal</i> bore steadily on. Several times
she passed tiny rocky islets over which were clouds
of screaming sea birds, and through their glasses the
boys could make out the thousands and thousands
of black and white birds that covered the rocks from
sea to summit. There were great white gannets, big
gray-and-white gulls, shining black cormorants, acres
of swallow-tailed terns, row after row of closely
packed auks, puffins, and guillemots. Even though
the schooner was a mile or more from the rookeries,
the harsh cries and screams of the countless birds
came to the boys’ ears in raucous chorus.</p>

<p>“Say, I thought there were a lot of birds down at
Tristan da Cunha,” said Jim. “But they weren’t a
patch on these.”</p>

<p>“Why, there must be millions of them!” agreed
Tom. “Wouldn’t it be fun to climb up there among
’em?”</p>

<p>Constantly in the schooner’s wake also were flocks
of birds and many of these were strange to the boys.
Some—big gray fellows with pearly white breasts
and enormously long wings—Mr. Kemp told them
were shearwaters. Others, that seemed constantly attacking
the gulls and terns, and that looked like swift-winged
hawks with spiked tails, they learned were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
jaegers and the captain told the boys these lived by
robbing the other birds, and a few snowy white creatures
that Tom thought were sheathbills were fulmar
petrels, he was told.</p>

<p>By now the weather was cold, cheerless, and chilly
and the boys were glad to don their winter clothes.
Though the sun shone brightly, the wind was raw
and had winter’s bite and sting to it and the
spray felt like ice water as it dashed into the boys’
faces.</p>

<p>“Whew, but it’s cold!” cried Tom as he came on
deck one morning, and buttoned his reefer and oilskins
tighter. “Feels like midwinter. I wonder—oh,
say, Jim! Look here!”</p>

<p>Fascinated, the two boys gazed about. On every
hand, some within a few hundred yards, others a mile
or two distant, still others mere ghostly forms upon
the horizon, were scores of gleaming, shimmering,
rainbow-tinted icebergs.</p>

<p>“Reckon there’s enough bergs to suit you!” exclaimed
Captain Edwards. “I never seen so pesky
many of ’em so far south this time o’ year. Must
ha’ been a mighty cold winter up this way.”</p>

<p>“Is that what makes it so cold?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the skipper, “a sailor can feel
ice long before he sees it, and there’s enough ’round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
us to keep all the whales in the sea in cold storage for
a million years.”</p>

<p>All through the day the <i>Narwhal</i> navigated slowly
through the berg-filled sea. Throughout the night
the boys were constantly aroused by shouts, the creaking
of tackle, and the rushing feet of the crew as the
schooner turned, and tacked, and picked her perilous
course among the mountains of ice. But the next
morning only a few distant bergs and scattered
masses of honeycombed floe ice were visible, and before
noon the gray shores of Labrador were sighted,
with the little port of Hebron straight ahead.</p>

<p>To the boys it was a wonderfully novel experience
to gaze shoreward at this out-of-the-world village in
the Arctic. They cried out in delight when tiny,
sharp-ended kayaks came dancing towards the <i>Narwhal</i>,
with their Eskimo occupants paddling furiously.
But as the tiny, skin-covered craft drew
near, the boys were disappointed.</p>

<p>“Oh pshaw!” cried Tom, “they don’t look like
Eskimos. They’re not dressed in furs, but are wearing
dirty overalls and caps. They look like Chinese
dressed up like whalemen.”</p>

<p>“Shure ’tis that they do!” agreed Mike, who stood
near. “B’glory they do be wan an’ the same specie
with the haythen Chinee, I do be thinkin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye’ll be seein’ plenty on ’em in hides an’ furs
afore ye’re done,” declared Cap’n Pem. “These
here boys is whalin’ han’s, an’ is sort o’ civ’lized.
But ye don’t expect ’em to be a-wearin’ o’ a everlastin’
lot o’ furs in this hot weather, do ye?”</p>

<p>“Hot weather!” cried Jim. “<em>I</em> call it cold.”</p>

<p>The old whaleman chuckled. “Waall, by cricky,
ye don’t know what’s a-comin’ to ye, then!” he declared.
“This here’s midsummer; but come ’long an’
meet these Eskimo lads.”</p>

<p>The kayaks were now alongside and the Eskimos
were clambering over the schooner’s rails. They
were a happy, good-natured-looking lot, with broad
yellow faces, flat noses, little slant, beady black eyes,
wide mouths, made still wider by a constant grin,
and lank, stiff black hair hanging to their shoulders.
All looked so much alike that the boys could not
understand how any one could tell one from
another, and all were identical in the matter of
dirtiness.</p>

<p>“Whew, but they <em>are</em> dirty!” exclaimed Jim. “I’ll
bet they haven’t ever taken a bath!”</p>

<p>“And aren’t they little!” added Tom. “Why,
they’re no bigger than boys.”</p>

<p>But if the two boys were interested in the Eskimos,
the latter were simply fascinated with the boys, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gathered about them talking and laughing and jabbering
in their own tongue.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp, Cap’n Pem and the skipper were also
busy conversing with two of the Eskimos who appeared
to be leaders or chiefs. When the second
officer addressed one of them in his own
dialect, the filthy little fellow fairly beamed with
pleasure.</p>

<p>Presently one of the men approached Tom and
held out a greasy, soot-blackened paw. “H’lo!” he
exclaimed with a broad grin. “Me Unavik, plenty
good whaler feller, betcher life!”</p>

<p>Tom laughed and shook hands gingerly. “Glad
to know you, Unavik. My name’s Tom. This is
Jim, my cousin. You going along with us?”</p>

<p>Unavik shook hands very cordially with Jim—far
too cordially to suit him in fact—and rolled his
tiny eyes as he looked over the schooner. “Betcher
life!” he announced. “Gimme chew t’bac. How
much feller you want?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Kemp, get us some tobacco,” cried Tom,
“this boy wants some.”</p>

<p>“Boy!” exclaimed Mr. Kemp, as he tossed over
some plugs of tobacco. “He’s an old man—great-grandfather,
I expect.”</p>

<p>Unavik bit off a huge chunk of the plug, passed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to his companions, and nodded his big head. “You
betcher!” he mumbled. “Me ol’ feller. Got fif’y
year mebbe.”</p>

<p>Then the other Eskimos began talking, telling their
names—which the boys could not remember or pronounce—jabbering
away with their quaint broken
English, and surrounding the boys, so that they were
thankful when Captain Skinner broke up the party
by inviting them to go ashore.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the flotilla of kayaks, the boat
pulled to the beach. To the boys’ surprise they
found that there were a number of white people in
the settlement; which contained several good buildings,
a tiny church, a little mission school, a post
office, and a police station.</p>

<p>There was also a low, rambling trading-post, presided
over by a red-faced, white-whiskered old
Scotchman and this proved the most interesting spot
to the boys.</p>

<p>Here was exactly the sort of place they had read
about in stories—the low-ceiled, big room with
shelves piled with blankets, sacks of meal, axes and
knives, guns and ammunition, and great bales of furs.
Antlers and heads decorated the walls. There was
a huge open hearth, snowshoes and dog sledges were
stacked in corners, polar bear skins covered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
floor and the stocky Eskimos, and even a few tall,
grave-faced Indians, were lounging about or dickering
over a trade with the clerk.</p>

<p>Here Captain Edwards secured a number of fur
garments as well as other supplies. Then with the
boys he strolled about the village. The boys had
never stopped to realize that Eskimos did not dwell
in ice igloos all the time and they were greatly surprised
to find them occupying roughly built huts and
much-patched tents of old canvas and skin. They
saw drying racks covered with thousands of salmon
and other fish which the Eskimo women—even more
unkempt and dirty than the men—were cleaning and
splitting and suspending on the racks. They visited
the church and talked with the good-natured, rotund
priest. They looked at the school and watched the
bright-eyed, broad-faced Eskimo kiddies striving to
master the rudiments of English and arithmetic.
They even stopped for a chat with the straight, clean-featured,
bronzed-faced, military-looking representative
of the law.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I never saw so many dogs!” exclaimed Tom
as they walked back toward the boat. “They simply
swarm here.”</p>

<p>Captain Edwards laughed and the police officer,
who was with them, smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I’ll warrant you never saw such pure bred
mongrels!” he chuckled.</p>

<p>“But they’re mighty useful to the natives—they
hunt with them, use them for teams and, if they’re
hard up, eat them.”</p>

<p>“Well, they look as if there’d be mighty little to
eat on them,” declared Jim.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, there was not much to be seen,
while the overpowering smell of fish which filled the
entire village almost nauseated the boys, and they
were mighty glad to be once more aboard the <i>Narwhal</i>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the boat again went ashore and
returned packed with Eskimo hands who had been
signed on. The bundles of garments and other things
were hoisted aboard, and with the Eskimos helping
the crew at the capstan, the <i>Narwhal’s</i> anchor was
hoisted, the sails were spread, and Hebron was left
astern.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BATTLE</span></h2>

<p>Steadily, day after day, the <i>Narwhal</i> continued
on her way northward. From morning
until night—throughout the short night as well—bergs
or floe ice were constantly in sight; but the
boys had become accustomed to such things and
scarcely gave the ice mountains a second glance.
They had spent hours searching each berg or ice cake
they passed, in the hopes of seeing another bear but,
aside from an occasional seal or flocks of birds, not
a living creature was seen.</p>

<p>The Eskimos, much to the boys’ surprise, proved
splendid sailors. Always at the mastheads men were
on the lookout for whales. At times the schooner
wallowed slowly through the cold green seas, with
barely enough wind to enable the captain to steer
clear of jagged cakes or towering bergs. At other
times, she tore storming through the tremendous
waves under shortened sails, rushing between giant
bergs, crashing into masses of drift ice hidden in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
foam of breaking waves. Again she would rest
motionless, becalmed, shrouded in dense fogs, while
resounding through the impenetrable mist came the
roar of surf on bergs, the crashing of falling ice
masses, and the shrill screams of sea birds. Then
every man was on the alert, peering with straining
eyes into the blanket of fog. A dozen times the boys’
hearts seemed to skip a beat, as, close at hand, a vast
white phantom loomed suddenly from the fog, and
the <i>Narwhal</i> rocked and rolled to the backwash of
the giant seas breaking upon ice. Again and again,
too, the schooner drifted so dangerously close to a
berg that boats were lowered and, straining at the
oars, the men towed the heavy vessel clear.</p>

<p>“Funny thing, that,” remarked Mr. Kemp, as the
<i>Narwhal</i> was thus being dragged from a towering
berg. “Put two ships, or a berg and a ship, in the
middle of the sea and the blamed things’ll drif’ together—jes
as if they loved comp’ny.”</p>

<p>“That is funny, though I never thought of it before,”
said Tom. “Don’t you suppose it’s currents
or something?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” declared the second officer, “just chuck
a couple of matches into a basin of water an’ leave
’em be, an’ you’ll see they’re boun’ to git side of each
other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, I have noticed that!” exclaimed Jim.
“What’s the reason?”</p>

<p>“Give her up,” replied Mr. Kemp. “Mystery to
me, but then there’s a heap of mysteries at sea.”</p>

<p>The boys had been greatly surprised too to find
that they could see throughout the night, that there
was no darkness, and that the sun set like a dull
yellow ball, hung at the rim of the sea for a space,
and almost before it disappeared, popped up again.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I never realized we were where the sun
never sets,” cried Tom the first time he noticed this.
“Somehow I can’t believe we’re way up here in the
Arctic.”</p>

<p>The boys were vastly interested and fascinated in
the Northern Lights, although compared with the
midnight sun, they were faint and pale. Captain
Edwards told them they would see the sight of their
lives when winter came, and the Aurora blazed in all
its glory.</p>

<p>But all these things grew tedious, and the boys
longed for a whale to be seen, or for some exciting
thing to happen. Then one day the shout so long
expected rang from the masthead, and at the cry,
“She blows!” all was excitement. Leaping into the
shrouds, the two boys ran up the rigging. As Captain
Edwards’ shout of, “Where away?” was answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by, “Three points off the lee bow!” the boys
stared in that direction to see two little fountains of
spray rise above the waves, and two immense
rounded black objects break the water.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! there’re two of them,” cried Tom.
“Oh, Captain Edwards, can’t we go after them?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” snapped the skipper. “I ain’t
riskin’ your lives goin’ on whales!”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose the owners order you to take us?”
demanded Jim.</p>

<p>Captain Edwards scowled and tried to look savage.
“Have to ’bey orders, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you’re ordered!” yelled the boys in
chorus, and without waiting to hear the skipper’s comment,
they raced toward Cap’n Pem’s boat and leaped
into it with the men.</p>

<p>“Here, what the tarnation ye doin’ in here?” demanded
Cap’n Pem as he saw the two boys. “This
here boat ain’t no place fer youngsters.”</p>

<p>“Owners’ orders,” grinned Tom, “come on,
Cap’n Pem, or Mr. Kemp’ll get those whales ahead
of you.”</p>

<p>“Waall, I’ll be blowed!” exclaimed the old whaleman,
as he entered the boat. “Annyhow, mind ye
keep still an’ don’t go a-screechin’ or a-talkin’. Bowheads
has derned sharp ears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, we’ll be as still as mice,” promised
Jim.</p>

<p>To the boys’ surprise, the men did not take to
their oars, but set up the short mast and spritsail
in the boat. With Cap’n Pem at the rudder,
they went speeding before the wind toward the two
whales.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp’s boat was also sailing swiftly toward
the huge creatures and neck and neck the two little
craft danced over the long green seas. Then, shifting
the helm slightly, Cap’n Pem swung around and
held his course directly towards the heads of the
monsters.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s funny,” whispered Tom. “When they
rowed after those whales on the <i>Hector</i> they always
went at them towards the tail. They’ll see the boat
coming this way, sure.”</p>

<p>A minute later Cap’n Pem raised his hand and the
men silently and quickly furled the sail and unshipped
the mast. Pulling noiselessly on the oars,
the crew drove the boat closer and closer to their
quarry. The two whales were swimming slowly
along, now and then sinking below the surface until
they were almost invisible, and then rising high and
blowing. The boys noticed that the little columns of
vapor rose from the middle of the creatures’ heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
instead of from the tip of the noses as was the case
with the sperm whales they had seen.</p>

<p>Tom nudged Jim. “That’s one thing I’ve learned,”
he whispered. “You can tell a bowhead whale from
a sperm by the blow.”</p>

<p>“Ssh!” muttered Jim. “Cap’n Pem’s scowling at
us.”</p>

<p>The boat steerer had now unsheathed his harpoon
and was standing in the bow and the boys, glancing
towards the other boat, saw that Mr. Kemp’s boat
steerer had done the same. Evidently both men
would strike at almost the same moment and the boys
hardly knew whether to keep their eyes fixed on their
own harpoonier or the other. Nearer and nearer to
the great black creatures the boat crept. The boys
could see the huge curved upper jaws, the gray
fringed masses of whalebone in the animals’ mouths
and even the rough growth of great barnacles on the
whales’ noses. Then, when it seemed as though the
boat would bump into the nearest monster, the craft
was deftly swung to one side. It slipped past the
enormous head and, before the surprised whale could
dive or dodge, the harpoonier lurched forward with a
grunt, and the immense, heavy, barbed iron struck
the whale with a sickening thud. Instantly the men
backed water furiously and not a second too soon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
With a crash that almost stunned the boys, the whale’s
stupendous flukes struck the water within a yard of
the frail boat, sending a deluge of water over the occupants,
and the next instant the boat was being
hurtled through the sea at a terrific pace as the
stricken whale strove to escape the stinging iron in
its side. White-faced, gripping the gunwale tightly,
the boys stole a hurried glance towards Mr. Kemp’s
boat and saw that he too was fast. But unlike their
own craft, which was being towed at express-train
speed, the second mate’s boat was being whirled in
circles as the whale milled.</p>

<p>Hardly had the two boys noticed this, when their
craft tipped perilously. Green water poured over
the rail as the whale altered his course. There was
a warning shout from Cap’n Pem and the boys saw
that they were headed directly towards Mr. Kemp’s
boat.</p>

<p>“Git ready to cut loose!” yelled Cap’n Pem.
“Dod gast the critter, we’ll foul Kemp!”</p>

<p>At his cry, one of the men started forward to
seize the hatchet. But as he raised it, the whale
again turned, the boat almost capsized and the man,
in his frantic effort to prevent himself from being
thrown overboard, dropped the hatchet which flashed
into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Before he could whip out his sheath knife, the
whale had dashed across the line fast to the second
mate’s boat. The two crafts careened, rocked, zigzagged
wildly and crashed together with a bump that
tumbled the occupants from their seats. Then, before
the dazed and struggling men could act, the two
boats were dashing through the sea with rails together
and with the two whales tearing at topmost
speed side by side as though having a race.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go, dod gast ’em!” screamed Cap’n Pem.
“Never seed nothin’ like it afore. Stand ready to
cut loose ef they mill or soun’!”</p>

<p>Onwards the two creatures sped. The schooner
was miles astern and then, so suddenly that the
skilled steersmen could not swerve their craft one
of the whales checked his onward rush and sounded.
The next instant he rose within a dozen rods of the
terrified boys, and, with thunderous, crashing, terrific
blows of his huge tail, strove to demolish the
boat and his enemies.</p>

<p>Speechless with deadly fear, the boys cowered in
the boat, while seemingly over their heads the great
black mass of flukes waved and whipped, striking
down to right, to left, in front of the frail cockleshell
of a boat, half filling it with water churned up
by the fearful, irresistible blows. The men strained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and shouted and pulled frantically, grim-faced, wild-eyed
and with superhuman efforts dodging the lashing,
death-dealing flukes by a hair’s breadth.</p>

<p>To the boys it seemed hours that they were within
that awful danger zone. Each second they expected
to be tossed high in air, bruised, battered, crushed
amid the shattered planks and timbers of the boat.</p>

<p>Then there was a sickening crash as Mr. Kemp’s
boat banged into them. For a moment the two craft
were locked tight and then the second mate’s boat
leaped ahead, dragging Pem’s boat with it. Scarcely
had it moved a yard, when the great trip-hammer
tail struck a fearful blow where it had been an
instant before, and, as the boat sprang into the air
on the upflung wave, the second mate’s boat drew
free and flew off after the whale to which it was fast.</p>

<p>“Go in!” yelled Cap’n Pem excitedly. “We’ll git
him!”</p>

<p>At his words, he dropped the steering oar, scrambled
forward and, as the boat steerer reached the
stern and seized the big oar, the grizzled old whaleman
braced his wooden leg against the knee chock
and seized a bomb lance. Then he tossed the
weapon down, unsheathed the long, keen-bladed hand
lance, and poised it ready to strike. Bobbing on the
water, still being churned up by the furious creature’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
tail, the boat crept close. The boys’ hearts seemed
to cease beating as they saw the great mountain of
black skin almost within arm’s length. Now but a
few feet separated the boat from the maddened whale.
Cap’n Pem gathered himself for the death stroke; the
boat’s bows seemed almost to touch the whale’s side,
when, without warning, the great body sank beneath
the sea and, drawn by the swirling suction of the
whale submerging, the boat leaped forwards directly
over the creature’s back. But the gray-headed old
veteran of a hundred battles with giant whales was
not to be cheated of his prey. As the boat lurched
forward into the eddying froth above the whale,
Cap’n Pem leaned over the boat’s bow, and with a
shout drove the long lance straight down.</p>

<p>The next instant the boat was flung high. It careened
dizzily, oars were wrenched from the men’s
hands and, as the mortally wounded whale flung himself
up, the craft slid like a toboggan from his back,
buried its bow beneath a wave, rose sluggishly, and
swung around broadside to the thrashing, rolling
mass of pain-crazed flesh and blood and bone.</p>

<p>So close was the boat to the whale’s side that the
men struggled to fend it off by their oars. With
wild yells and shouts, Cap’n Pem warned them to
keep close; for all around them the awful tail was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
striking, crashing, whipping, as the dying whale
lashed the water into a maelstrom of foam and, only
by keeping the boat so close to the monster that his
tail could not reach them, could their lives be saved.</p>

<p>That they could escape seemed impossible. They
were in the very center of a cyclone of mortal peril,
a circle of death, and even the tough, fearless, experienced
whalemen grew white-faced. Their jaws were
hard set and they knew that any second might spell
their doom.</p>

<p>Then, with one stupendous effort, the whale reared
its head high. The flukes swept above the boat, a
crimson column spurted from the monster’s head
and, with a whistling sigh like escaping steam, the
whale rolled upon its side, dead.</p>

<p>“Fin up!” screamed Cap’n Pem. “By Moses, that
there was the closest shave I ever seen. Jes dumb
luck, nothin’ more!”</p>

<p>At this instant a strange sound issued from the
bottom of the whaleboat. Cap’n Pem’s jaw fell.
The men stared at one another wonderingly.</p>

<p>“What’s thet?” gasped the old whaleman.</p>

<p>Tom leaned forward, reached into a locker and
drew out—the black cat!</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem’s eyes seemed about to burst from their
sockets. “Waall, I’ll be——” he began and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
stood staring absolutely bereft of speech as Tom
dragged out the canvas bucket and disclosed four
blinking-eyed kittens.</p>

<p>“Now what about bad luck!” he cried triumphantly.</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem scratched his head, frowned and spat
over the boat’s side. “I calc’late them kittens must
ha’ changed the luck,” he declared. “I don’t recollec’
ever hearin’ o’ sech a thing afore. But jes
the same, I’ll bet ye if that there cat hadn’t been
’long of us, we’d never ha’ had all this here fracas.
Wussedest fight I ever seed.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GLACIER</span></h2>

<p>Now that the excitement was over and the
boys had a chance to look about, they
searched the sea for Mr. Kemp. But nowhere
was he to be seen. Then their glance turned
towards the schooner, and Tom uttered a frightened
cry.</p>

<p>“The <i>Narwhal</i>’s gone!”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem turned from where he was directing
the men as they labored to get a fluke chain about the
dead whale’s tail, shaded his eyes and swept a swift
glance around the horizon. “Reckon she are,” he
remarked quite undisturbed. “Get a waif up,
Nate,” he continued, addressing the boat steerer.
“Swan if I know whar she be. An’ looks like
Kemp’s hull down, too.”</p>

<p>“But what will we do?” cried Jim. “How can
we get to the <i>Narwhal</i>?”</p>

<p>“Won’t,” replied the old whaleman, once more
bending to his work. “Let the schooner come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
us. Reckon the skipper hain’t los’ track o’ us.”</p>

<p>“Ye see,” explained the boat steerer as he fastened
a red flag to the mast and, with two of the men to
help him, stepped the spar, “folks ’board the
schooner can see us a heap farther than we kin see
them. They’ll be havin’ a lookout to the to’gallan’
crosstrees an’ keep track o’ where we be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand,” said Tom. “But say, Nate,
why did you go for the head of that whale? When
we were on the <i>Hector</i> they were always careful to
go on them from the tail end.”</p>

<p>“Them was sparm whales,” replied the boat
steerer. “A sparm whale kin see for’rard but not
aft, an’ a right whale or bowhead kin see aft an’ not
for’rard. ’Sides, a sparm fights mos’ly with his jaw
an’ a right or a bowhead fights with his flukes. ‘Bewar’
o’ a sparm’s jaws an’ a right whale’s flukes,’ is
a ol’ whalin’ motter.”</p>

<p>“But what’s become of Mr. Kemp, do you suppose?”
queried Jim. “Do you think anything’s happened
to him?”</p>

<p>“Naw, I guess he’s jus’ been towed out o’ sight,”
declared Nate. “Anyhow it’s every man for hisself
a-goin’ arter whales. Reckon the Old Man kin see
him.”</p>

<p>The fluke chain was now fast about the whale’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
“small,” as the portion of the creature’s body near
the tail is called, and the boat, fastened to it by the
stout hemp line, rode as steadily and as easily as
though moored to an island. The immense carcass
formed a lee, and the oil oozing from his wounds,
smoothed the water, making a broad “slick.”</p>

<p>“Purty good-sized critter,” commented Cap’n
Pem, as he seated himself and lit his pipe. “Bet
ye he’ll turn a hundred bar’ls, an’ nigh half a ton
o’ bone. Put up a right smart fight though—blowed
if he didn’t. Waall, boys, how did ye like the fun?”</p>

<p>“Fine, now it’s over,” laughed Jim. “But I admit
I wished I was on the <i>Narwhal</i> a good many times
while that old whale was thrashing around with his
flukes.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, but he did come near smashing us!” cried
Tom. “Just the same, I’m glad we were here, and
that the first time we went in on a whale he was a
fighter. Say, won’t the boys back home open their
eyes when we tell them about this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s the <i>Narwhal</i>!” exclaimed Jim, who
had stood up and was gazing about. “And not a bit
where I expected her to be.”</p>

<p>“Waall, if ye could ha’ kep’ track o’ which way
was which, ye’d ’a been a heap sight better’n I be at
keepin’ my bearin’s,” chuckled Cap’n Pem. “By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
heck, fer a spell I actooaly did think that there ol’
whale was a-goin’ fer to git the best on us.”</p>

<p>“Would have if ye hadn’t a-fetched him as we run
over his back,” declared one of the men. “By glory,
Cap’n, that was some stunt ye pulled off. But say,
it mos’ made me split, a-seein’ of ye a-diggin’ that
lance into the water like as if ye was a-spearin’
eels.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, that weren’t nothin’,” declared Cap’n
Pem. “I don’ calc’late to miss a chanct even if the
dumb critter do sound jes when I’m a-gettin’ ready
fer to lance him.”</p>

<p>“But he almost wrecked us!” exclaimed Tom. “If
he’d come up a second sooner, he would have capsized
the boat and we’d all have been drowned or
smashed by his flukes.”</p>

<p>The old whaleman chuckled. “Waall, I reckon
we mought ha’ been,” he admitted. “But we wasn’t.
’Sides, no whaleman never thinks o’ sech things.
We wuz out fer to git this here whale, and it’s git
him or git stove.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you use the bomb lance?” asked
Jim. “You had a good chance.”</p>

<p>“Look here, son,” said the old man petulantly.
“I was brung up along with a reg’lar iron an’ a reg’lar
lance. These here new-fangled contraptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
may be all right fer them as likes ’em, but give me
the old fashion’ weepons every time. By gum, I
want ter see whar I’m a-drivin’ o’ the lance at.
’Sides, any dumb-foozled lan’lubber could git whales
by a settin’ off an’ a-shootin’ of ’em. They ain’t no
sport in it.”</p>

<p>By now the <i>Narwhal</i> was within a quarter of a mile
of the boat. As her yards were swung and she was
hove to, the men picked up their oars and headed for
the schooner. As they drew alongside, Cap’n Pem
shouted up to Captain Edwards and asked if they
had seen the second officer’s boat.</p>

<p>“No, he was towed hull down,” replied the skipper.
“But we can fetch him all right. Just stick a waif
in that whale, get your boat aboard and we’ll run
down to him.”</p>

<p>One of the men scrambled on to the whale’s body,
and drove a sharp pointed iron bar bearing a flag at
the end into the carcass. Then, casting loose the line
to the fluke chain, the crew clambered on to the
schooner and hoisted the boat to its davits.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, how did you like it?” asked Captain
Edwards as Tom and Jim reached the deck.
“Had a right pretty tussle—I was watchin’ you from
aloft.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” declared Tom. “But we <em>were</em> scared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
some of the time, and oh, we had a great joke
on Cap’n Pem! The cat was in the boat and
she had four kittens.”</p>

<p>The skipper roared. “Well, that must have
broken the spell!” he exclaimed. “What did Pem
say?”</p>

<p>“Same thing,” replied Jim, “but he added that
if it hadn’t been for the cat we wouldn’t have had
so much trouble.”</p>

<p>“Waall, I bet ye that’s so!” burst out the old
whaleman. “An’ there’ll be other bad luck a-comin’
from the dumb critter.”</p>

<p>“B’ the powers!” exclaimed Mike who stood near.
“’Tis a ol’ fool yez be. Shure, didn’t yez know
a cat bein’ afther havin’ kits aboorrd a ship do be
the foinest luck in the world? B’gorra ’tis four
av thim yez is afther sayin’? Thin ’tis four whales
yez should be afther gettin’.”</p>

<p>Instantly, as usual, the two one-legged old sailors
began to argue, and the boys and the captain turned
away to let them have it out. Presently, from the
masthead, came a shout that the missing boat was
sighted. Soon it was visible from the deck. But
the boys, even with their glasses, could not distinguish
a whale fast to Mr. Kemp’s boat.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they lost it,” said Jim. “Say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
if they did, Cap’n Pem will swear it was the cat.”</p>

<p>But a moment later, Tom’s sharp eyes spied a
tiny rag fluttering above the waves some distance
from the second mate’s boat. “There’s the whale!”
he shouted. “See, it’s got a waif on it.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Jim. And then a moment
later, “Gosh, Tom, is that another waif—over there
to the west of the boat?”</p>

<p>Tom looked steadily for a moment. “Golly, it
is!” he cried. “Oh, Captain Edwards, they’ve got
two whales!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the skipper hurrying to the boys
and taking Tom’s glasses. “By the great red herring,
you’re right!”</p>

<p>“Why in tarnation ain’t he fas’ to ’em?” cried
Captain Pem, who had stopped his discussion with
Mike at the boys’ announcement.</p>

<p>“Expect he was pullin’ for the ship and couldn’t
tow ’em,” said the skipper.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were within hailing distance.
Then the schooner was hove to, and the boat
drew alongside.</p>

<p>“See you had good luck, Mr. Kemp!” cried the
Captain heartily. “Pem got a big bull too—put up
purtiest tussle I ever seen—and that’s three bowheads
in a afternoon! Guess Mike’s right about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
those kittens, boys! Only need one more whale to
make the four!”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp grinned. “If you’ll jus’ run down to
the east’ard a couple o’ miles, you’ll find t’other one,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“What in thunder ye talkin’ ’bout?” cried Cap’n
Pem, staring at the second mate as though he thought
he had gone mad. “Ye don’t mean to stan’ there
an’ say—oh, ’tain’t nat’ral!”</p>

<p>“True jus’ the same,” grinned Mr. Kemp. “I
beat ye by two bowheads, Pem.”</p>

<p>“Shure, Oi knowed it,” commented Mike. “B’gorra,
’tis hopin’ the blessed cat’ll be afther havin’
o’ kittens iviry day, b’jabbers.”</p>

<p>Every one aboard the schooner was in high spirits
over the phenomenal luck of getting four whales in
one day, and as one after the other of the big carcasses
were picked up and made fast by stout hemp
lines, the men sang and laughed. Nate, the harpoonier,
roared out the quaint song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My father’s a hedger and ditcher,</div>
<div class="verse">My mother does nothing but spin,</div>
<div class="verse">While I hunt whales for my living,</div>
<div class="verse">Good Lord, how the money comes in!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And lustily all joined in the chorus, for thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of dollars had been won in the past few hours, and
every member of the <i>Narwhal’s</i> crew would share in
the prize. Even old Captain Pem grudgingly agreed
that he could find no fault with the ship’s luck, and admitted
the black cat’s spell must have been broken.
“But don’t fergit weather’s allers ca’mest jes afore
a squall,” he said as a parting shot.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp’s three bowheads were soon alongside,
but that taken by Cap’n Pem’s boat was several miles
distant, and the schooner could make no progress
with the light wind with the three huge carcasses in
tow.</p>

<p>“Now aren’t you glad we had that motor put in?”
asked Tom of Cap’n Pem, as Mike started the motor
and, with the staccato reports of the exhaust echoing
over the Arctic sea, the <i>Narwhal</i> slowly pushed
through the long swells, with the dead whales like
a string of deeply laden barges trailing astern.</p>

<p>“Waall, I reckon I got ter admit ’tis a bit handy,”
replied the old whaleman. “An’ I ain’t so all-fired
ol’ fashioned I can’t admit it, neither. An’ time we
gits inter the ice pack, I reckon it’ll come in mighty
useful, too. But jes the same I ain’t got no use
fer bumb lances nor dartin’ guns, nor such new-fangled
contraptions. No, siree, my father and
my granther used good, hand-wrought irons, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
what was good ernough fer them’s good ernough for
me, by cricky.”</p>

<p>With the four whales alongside, cutting in and
boiling began in earnest, and so anxious was the
crew to get the oil and bone stowed and start after
more whales, that they worked almost without cessation,
cutting their periods or watches of rest to half
the usual time.</p>

<p>“Mighty glad we took them Eskimos aboard over
to Hebron,” remarked Mr. Kemp, as he paused a moment
from his labors and watched the busy brown
men, who had stripped to the waist and were scrambling
about, jabbering incessantly, reminding the boys
of a group of big monkeys. “And that ‘boy’ as you
called him, Unavik, is a corker. Guess we’ll make
him boss of the Eskimo bunch.”</p>

<p>A little later Unavik approached the two boys,
grinning from ear to ear, covered with grease and
soot, and gnawing at a strip of raw blubber. “H’lo!”
he exclaimed. “Plenty work me tell. Suppose you
no got chew t’bac?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll get you some,” said Tom, and hurrying
to the cabin he returned with a plug.</p>

<p>The Eskimo bit a huge piece from the tobacco,
tore off a mouthful of the blubber and industriously
chewing both together smacked his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gosh, but that must be <em>some</em> combination!” exclaimed
Jim.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s a regular treat to him,” said Tom.
“But it makes me sick just to think of eating that
oily blubber, not to mention the tobacco.”</p>

<p>“All right, me go work, you betcher!” ejaculated
Unavik as soon as he could talk. “You good frien’.
Bimeby me go ’long hunt bear ’side you feller.”
Stuffing the tobacco in his grease-soaked trousers,
the Eskimo hurried back to the cutting stage.</p>

<p>All through the night, with the Aurora flickering
above the northern horizon, and with the dull orange
sun just visible upon the southern rim of the sea,
the men toiled on. All through the following day
the dripping strips of blubber were hauled on deck,
the mincing knives thudded through the greasy mass
upon the horse, the try works belched thick columns
of black smoke, the cooper’s hatchet rang incessantly
as casks were headed up, the tackles groaned
and whined as the filled barrels were lowered into
the hold, great masses of the whalebone were piled
on deck and carcass after carcass, having been
stripped of its precious covering of blubber, was
cut loose and drifted slowly away from the ship.</p>

<p>Screaming, screeching, and squawking, a vast flock
of sea birds had gathered about, swooping fearlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
among the men to tear bits of flesh and blubber from
the whales. The birds rested by hundreds upon the
grease-slicked water, sweeping back and forth above
the decks, and hovering in clouds above the discarded,
floating bodies. Never had the boys seen
so many birds. They spent hours watching them as
they sailed and wheeled and fought over the scraps
and offal. Then at last the fourth carcass was cast
adrift, the final pieces of blubber were boiled, the
smoke from the try works dwindled and died out,
the casks were stowed, and with over three hundred
barrels of oil and more than two tons of choice bone
in her hold, the schooner’s sails were hoisted. The
men cleaned and swabbed the decks, and onward
into the north and east the <i>Narwhal</i> held her course.</p>

<p>For two days the schooner sailed steadily on, but
no whale, no tiny puff of spray, broke the even surface
of the sea. On the third morning, the boys
glanced ahead to see soft gray mountains looming
against the sky.</p>

<p>“Greenland!” announced Mr. Kemp who was on
watch.</p>

<p>“Gosh, it doesn’t seem possible,” exclaimed Tom,
gazing fixedly at the distant land. “Now we really
<em>are</em> in the Arctic. Will we have a chance to go
ashore, Mr. Kemp?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess you will,” replied the second officer. “The
skipper’s goin’ to get some more Eskimos yonder—puttin’
into Disko Bay. Shouldn’t wonder if he did
some sealin’ or walrus huntin’ too.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! won’t it be great to say we’ve really been
in Greenland?” cried Jim. “Golly, I never realized
there were mountains there though.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the land grew more distinct. The boys
could see deep bays—which Captain Edwards told
them were fiords—great clefts cut far into the cliffs
and marvelously colored with soft purples, mauves
and blue. Here and there a valley between the hills
gleamed green as an emerald, while vast, glistening,
white masses of ice and snow zigzagged through
narrow defiles. Stretching seaward from the shores
was a broad white plain that rose and fell and moved
like a restless white sea.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> that white?” asked Tom who could not
make it out.</p>

<p>“Shore ice, pan ice,” replied the captain. “Tide
and wind sets it inshore, but it’s all pretty mushy
now. Look, there’s a bit of it ahead.”</p>

<p>Bobbing up and down upon the waves, gleaming
like silver in the sunshine, the boys saw several acres
of drifting ice. As the schooner slipped by it, they
exclaimed in delight at the wonderful beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
vivid green and blue of the submerged parts of the
ice.</p>

<p>“Why, the water’s as clear as in the West Indies!”
exclaimed Jim. “And almost as blue. Say, I always
thought this place was dull and gray and covered
with ice and snow, and it’s as fresh and lovely as
anything. Now I know why it’s called Greenland.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s that big white wall there?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“It looks like a great white cliff.”</p>

<p>The skipper glanced shoreward. “That’s a glacier,”
he replied. “River of ice, like. They’re
what make icebergs.”</p>

<p>“How on earth can they make icebergs?” asked
Jim, studying the precipitous face of the glacier.</p>

<p>“Water cuts under ’em and they break off, and
the pieces are the bergs,” explained the captain.
“That’s what we call calving.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the prettiest colored thing I’ve ever
seen,” declared Jim. “It’s for all the world like a
giant opal and constantly changing. Gosh, it doesn’t
look like any ice I ever saw.”</p>

<p>The <i>Narwhal</i> was now sailing close to the outer
edge of the pack ice and a sharp lookout was kept
for seals or whales. Then, rounding a jutting cape,
the boys saw a deep blue fiord with a stupendous
glacier leading down a great valley to the rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
beach. The mouth of the fiord was clear of ice, and
so the <i>Narwhal’s</i> course was shifted, and she slipped
into the dark shadows of the towering cliffs. The
water, calm as a millpond, was deepest indigo, and
upon it the rocky heights and the great glacier were
reflected as in a burnished mirror. Fascinated, the
boys were gazing at the beautiful picture when the
lookout’s hail reached the deck. “<em>Pod</em> o’ seal over
to wind’ard,” he shouted. “Close in shore!”</p>

<p>Captain Edwards sprang into the rigging, gazed in
the direction indicated and leaped back to the deck.
“Harps!” he announced. “We’ll have a try for ’em.
Stand by to lower away the port boat. Mr. Kemp,
you take charge, you’ve had more experience with
them critters than any one else.”</p>

<p>“Can we go?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Guess you can,” responded the captain, “no
danger sealin’.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the boat was in the water, the
sealing clubs, with guns and rifles, were placed in
readiness, and with a will the crew pulled toward
the dark specks that marked the dozing, unsuspecting
seals.</p>

<p>As they drew near shore, the mountains seemed to
overhang the boat, and the face of the glacier loomed
enormous against the background of the hills. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and there, grounded on bars or shoals, were small
bergs and one enormous one, with lofty pinnacles like
the many spires of a great cathedral, was floating
majestically near the head of the fiord. From the
cliffs, where they stood in endless rows, the auks,
guillemots, puffins, and cormorants gazed down and
protested in raucous cries. Presently the boys could
distinguish the seals—great brownish yellow creatures
with dark harp-shaped markings on their backs—a
hundred or more, drawn far up on the shore
among the rotting cakes of ice and sleeping soundly
in the warm summer sunshine.</p>

<p>Silently the boat crept nearer. Without a sound,
it grated against the shore. Armed with their clubs
and one or two firearms, the men leaped towards the
herd. Instantly the seals were awake, their heads
were thrown up, their big lustrous eyes turned wonderingly.
Then in terror at the onrushing horde of
men, with short sharp barks and yelps of fear, they
commenced scrambling towards the sea and safety.
But the men, led by the Eskimos, had spread in a
half circle. They were between the seals and the
water. As the first panic-stricken creatures reached
the shouting, yelling crew, the heavy clubs rose and
fell with dull, sickening thuds. The seals dropped
dying in their tracks and the others, turning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
strove blindly to get away from these new enemies.</p>

<p>“Gosh, it makes me sick!” exclaimed Tom as he
saw the slaughter of the poor helpless creatures.
“It’s worse than killing sea elephants. No more
sealing for me!”</p>

<p>“Nor me either,” declared Jim, “it’s just murder.
And aren’t they pretty things!”</p>

<p>In a few moments it was all over. The beach and
ice were strewn with the dead seals—not a single
one had escaped—and the men, flushed and perspiring
with exertion, and shouting triumphantly, tossed
aside their bludgeons and commenced stripping the
hides from the dead seals.</p>

<p>The two boys shouldered their rifles and started
along the beach towards the glacier, now and then
stopping to pick up some odd shell or bright-colored
pebble. Once they came to a tiny brook
brawling over the stones and followed it into a little
valley, rich green with grass and brilliant with scarlet
poppies and bright golden yellow flowers. From almost
under Tom’s feet, a ptarmigan whirred up and
stopping, the boys discovered the nest filled to overflowing
with the heavily spotted brown eggs. A moment
later Jim had his turn as he flushed a black and
white snow bunting and found its cleverly hidden nest
and spotted green eggs in their bed of fur and down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
All about, from waving weeds stalks and jutting
bowlders, buntings and longspurs, gray sparrows and
dainty horned larks twittered and sang. From far
up in the blue sky came a sweet rollicking song as
a lark soared and bubbled over with joy. The boys,
seating themselves on a ledge of rock, looked
silently about, enjoying the peaceful scene and unable
to believe that this warm sun, these bright
flowers, these trilling birds were in far-off Greenland,
a land they had always pictured as barren, desolate,
and cold. Then, as they retraced their steps towards
the beach, Jim jumped as a big Arctic hare leaped
from its resting place and went bounding off among
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Whew, he <em>was</em> a whopper!” cried Tom. “Why
didn’t you shoot him, Jim? He’d have tasted fine
for a change from canned meat.”</p>

<p>Jim laughed. “I was so startled I forgot I had
a gun,” he admitted, “and say, I’m rather glad I
did. Somehow I’d hate to shoot anything here, it’s
so pretty and happy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we can struggle along without
stewed rabbit for a while yet,” said Tom. “It
does seem kind of a shame to kill anything
here.”</p>

<p>“The men aren’t half through yet,” announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Jim as the two boys reached the beach once more.
“Say, Tom, let’s walk over to the glacier.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom readily, “it isn’t far
and it will be fine to see it close to. Say, doesn’t
the <i>Narwhal</i> look like a speck off there—with all
these big hills round!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Jim, “and just think of how she
looked when we first saw her being towed into Fair
Haven. Say, Tom, it’s almost weird, looking at her
off there and with us here and thinking she’s that
same old tub we saw, and that we came clear up
here on her.”</p>

<p>“Yep, and that we’re her principal owners,”
chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>So, talking and chatting, the two drew closer
and closer to the towering face of the great glacier.
Presently they stopped to admire the play of colors
in the mighty mass of ice and, to get a clearer view,
they clambered up the steep slope of the rocky hillside.
They were standing there, gazing at the gigantic
face of the glacier, when there was a splintering,
awful roar, the whole end of the glacier plunged
forward like a falling mountain and, as the crash of
its fall echoed and reverberated from the hills, a
mighty, foaming, surging wave came hissing and
roaring up the beach. Never had the boys seen such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a huge comber. Green and irresistible, it raced
straight towards them, the mighty swell raised by the
plunge of the stupendous mass of ice. The boys,
already startled and frightened half out of their wits
by the deafening crash of the falling ice, stood
breathless and wide-eyed, watching the oncoming
wave that threatened to engulf them.</p>

<p>But they were just beyond its reach. With the
upflung spray drenching them to the skin, the wave
dashed itself against the rocks at their feet and then,
with a sullen growl, drew back. Again and again
the big waves came tearing in, but each was smaller
than the preceding, and soon the beach stretched
smooth and clear to the gently lapping ripples.</p>

<p>“Whew! it was lucky we climbed up here!” exclaimed
Jim. “Say, it wouldn’t have been any fun
to have been down on the beach.”</p>

<p>“Or alongside that glacier,” added Tom. “Jiminy,
look at that berg! We <em>are</em> lucky! We’ve seen
a glacier calving!”</p>

<p>“And it’s <em>some</em> calf!” cried Jim, as he gazed at the
enormous berg which but a few moments before had
been a portion of the glacier.</p>

<p>“And look at the <i>Narwhal</i>!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>The schooner was tossing and bobbing as if beset
by a tempest, the masts cutting great arcs against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sky, the bow shipping green water, white froth pouring
from the scuppers.</p>

<p>“Golly, that berg <em>did</em> set a sea going!” ejaculated
Jim. “I’ll bet Cap’n Pem’ll swear it was all due to
the cat.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s no bad luck anyhow, unless—Say!
Jim, how about the men? Gosh! perhaps they were
drowned or smashed by the waves. Come on, let’s
beat it!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">WHALES AND WHALES</span></h2>

<p>Shouts assured the boys that the men were still
there long before they rounded a point and
came in sight of the scene of the killing. They
had not escaped unscathed. The rending crash of
the falling ice had warned them and, knowing what
would follow, they had raced up the beach beyond
reach of the waves. But the boat, lifted on the tremendous
sea, had been left high and dry, wedged
among the rocks and ice, hopelessly shattered. The
bodies of the seals had been scattered far and wide.
Some were floating far from shore, others had been
cast high on the beach. The skins which had already
been stripped from the creatures were rolled and
tossed among the rocks for a hundred yards up and
down the shore. The men searched out the pelts and
proceeded to skin the remaining seals. A waif had
been raised on the boat’s mast to attract attention of
those on the schooner, and as the boys arrived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
spot another boat was speeding across the bay towards
them.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Mr. Kemp as he caught sight of
the boys. “I was just about settin’ off to look for
you. Feared you might ha’ been catched in that
wave or somethin’. Where was you?”</p>

<p>“We were on the way to the glacier,” said Tom,
“and got up on a rock to see it better when it calved.”</p>

<p>“Darned lucky you wasn’t ’longside of it,” declared
the second officer. “Don’t never go foolin’ ’round a
glacier this time of year. Never can tell when they’re
goin’ to bust loose. Stove our boat too, darn it.”</p>

<p>By the time the second boat arrived, the last of the
seals was skinned. Piling the hides and the contents
of the stove boat into the other craft, and dragging
the shattered boat to the water, the party set out for
the <i>Narwhal</i>, towing the injured craft.</p>

<p>“By gum, didn’t I tell ye thet cat was a-goin’ fer to
bring bad luck?” exclaimed old Pem as the boys and
Mr. Kemp climbed over the rail, and the old whaleman
saw the boat with its shattered planking.</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” burst out the second officer. “Don’t
care if you are mate, you’re an old croaker. Ain’t
nothin’ to do with the puss. You know’s well as any
one glaciers is always calving in summer.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem’s eyes opened in wonder and he stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
speechless at Mr. Kemp. Twice he opened his
mouth as if about to speak, but both times he failed.
At last, shaking his grizzled head dolefully, he turned
and walked away.</p>

<p>Soon the schooner was again under way, chugging
out of the fiord under her own power. Once more
in the open sea, she heeled to the wind and bore northward
for Disko Bay. As she came in sight of Disko
Island, passing close to the many islets at the bay’s
mouth, the boys were enthusiastic over the beauty of
the scene. Presently they caught sight of a little
cluster of huts and tents before which a row of kayaks
were drawn upon the beach.</p>

<p>Before the <i>Narwhal’s</i> anchor plunged overboard
the schooner was surrounded by the little bobbing
skin canoes. To the boys’ joy they saw that these
Eskimos were clad in skins and were exactly like the
pictures they had always seen of these people. The
Eskimo hands on the schooner greeted them with yells
and chattered rapidly with them. Presently the newcomers
were scrambling on to the <i>Narwhal’s</i> deck.
But at close quarters these Greenland Eskimos proved
as greasy and filthy as those the boys had seen at Hebron.</p>

<p>“I never saw such dirty people!” exclaimed Tom
as he edged away from the ill-smelling crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be expectin’ of ’em to be nothin’ else, do
ye?” said Cap’n Pem. “How the Sam Hill they goin’
fer to keep clean? Reckon ye’d be a mite dirty if all
the fresh water ye had fer to bathe in wuz melted
snow.”</p>

<p>“But I should think they’d all be sick and die,”
said Jim. “Why, they must live exactly like
pigs.”</p>

<p>“Shure thin’, ain’t pigs the hilthiest av’ cr’atures!”
exclaimed Mike.</p>

<p>But later, when, the boys went ashore, they found
much of interest, despite the odors and the dirty inhabitants.
They saw fat-faced Eskimo women, their
hair done up in big greasy topknots, industriously
chewing skins to cure them. They saw others carrying
their bright-eyed little kiddies in the pouchlike
hoods on their backs. They peered into the smoky
reindeer skin tents and saw the soapstone lamps with
their wicks of moss floating in oil. They saw the
men carving walrus tusks into weapons and utensils,
and they watched a couple of boys as they broke
a dog team to harness. The Eskimos seemed very
friendly and good-natured, and when Tom uttered an
exclamation of surprise as a boy lashed out with
his rawhide whip and deftly flipped the ear of a
surly dog a dozen feet distant, the young Eskimo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
grinned broadly and said something in his own
tongue.</p>

<p>“Says if you’ll give him a coin he’ll show you
something,” interpreted Mr. Kemp who stood near.</p>

<p>Tom tossed the boy a quarter which the youngster
examined critically, and bit with his firm white teeth.
Apparently satisfied, he walked a short distance away
and placed the coin upon the top of a little bowlder.
Retracing his steps until fully twenty feet from the
coin, he swung his whip about his head, suddenly
lurched forward and with a crack like a pistol the
snakelike lash struck the coin and sent it spinning
high in the air. Dashing forward the boy caught it
dexterously as it fell.</p>

<p>“Gosh, that <em>was</em> fine!” cried Tom. “Whew! he
<em>can</em> handle a whip!”</p>

<p>Instantly the two boys were surrounded by the
Eskimo lads, all clamoring for a chance to exhibit
their skill and for some time the two boys were busy
handing out their loose change and watching the Eskimos
flip them from resting places with whips or hit
them with their arrows as the coins were tossed into
the air.</p>

<p>Not until the boys’ money was exhausted did they
stop. Then, followed by the troop of young Eskimos,
Tom and Jim continued on their round of the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never knew Eskimos lived in tents,” said Jim as
Mr. Kemp stopped to bargain with a wrinkled old
man for some carved ivory curios. “I thought they
lived in igloos.”</p>

<p>The second mate laughed. “Funny, most all folks
get that idea,” he replied. “Wonder how they think
these lads is goin’ to build snow houses in summer.”</p>

<p>“Well you see we never realized it was summer—that
is, warm—up here,” said Tom. “Somehow we
always thought of the Arctic as cold and covered with
ice all the year round.”</p>

<p>“Won’t we have a lot to tell the fellows at home?”
said Jim. “How these women chew the skins to tan
them, and how they live in wigwams just like Indians
and say—what’s that man doing? Look, he’s
splitting up a match.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the Eskimo they were watching was
very carefully splitting a sulphur match into tiny
shavings with his knife while holding it over a bit of
dry moss.</p>

<p>“He’s getting a light for his pipe or a lamp,” replied
Mr. Kemp. “Matches are scarce and the Eskimos
ain’t folks to waste nothing. When they want
to use a match, they split it same’s he’s doin’, and
bimeby one of the pieces’ll light and he’ll have his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fire, and ’stead of havin’ a match less he’ll have a
dozen more. Look, there she goes!”</p>

<p>“Well that <em>is</em> funny!” cried Tom. “But those tiny
slivers can’t be used. They’d break just as soon as
he tried to scratch them.”</p>

<p>“Trust the Eskimos to look after that,” chuckled
the second mate. “When he wants to use one of them
slivers, he’ll tie it on to a bit of bone afore he
scratches it.”</p>

<p>“Gee, but they <em>are</em> clever!” declared Jim. “Talk
about thrift!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you another thing,” went on Mr. Kemp.
“Tobaccer’s scarce too, so, after they’ve smoked a
pipe for a spell, they cut up the wooden stem and
smoke that along with the tobaccer. Jus’ as good
flavor, I reckon, and goes a blamed long ways towards
savin’. Yes, sir, they’re a thrifty bunch.
Even a Scotchman’d have blamed hard work to teach
’em much. And say, don’t throw away them brass
shells from your rifles. Over to Hudson Bay you
can trade ’em for good pelts. Yes, sir, get good fox
skins for a shell each.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re kidding us!” cried Tom. “They can’t
be such fools as all that.”</p>

<p>“Honest Injun, I ain’t,” protested the mate. “And
they ain’t fools to do it. What a thing’s worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
depends on how much you want it. And them
Eskimos want brass shells a heap more’n they want
fox skins. They can go out and get foxes most
any old time, but they can’t dig up brass or shoot
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose that’s so,” said Jim thoughtfully.
“Sorry we threw away those shells we fired at the
bear, but I guess we’ll have plenty more before we’re
through.”</p>

<p>Although the boys were anxious to get some of the
beautiful skins they saw, Mr. Kemp advised them to
wait, assuring them that they’d be able to get all they
wanted from the Eskimos about Hudson Bay, where
the <i>Narwhal</i> would winter, even if they did not succeed
in killing the creatures themselves. But they
could not resist the temptation to buy a complete fur
suit each. Tom chose a costume of white baby bear
trimmed with blue fox, while Jim secured a suit of
sheeny, silvery seal elaborately ornamented with intricate
designs worked in strips of reindeer skin and
with a fringe of white fox fur about the hood and
collar.</p>

<p>Both boys roared with laughter as they tried on
the suits while the Eskimos gathered about and joined
in the merriment.</p>

<p>“Gosh, if you wear that and any one sees you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
they’ll take you for a bear and shoot you,” declared
Jim.</p>

<p>“And if they see you they’ll think you’re a new
kind of walrus,” retorted Tom.</p>

<p>“Hello, been getting outfits, eh?” exclaimed Captain
Edwards who now appeared. “But come along,
we’re getting off within the hour.”</p>

<p>A dozen Eskimos had been obtained at the village,
and in addition, the skipper had secured several bales
of valuable furs, nearly two hundred pounds of
walrus ivory, and a quantity of whalebone.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have a chance to hunt walrus, boys,”
remarked Captain Edwards as the boat pulled towards
the <i>Narwhal</i>. “We’ll run across to Baffin
Island. These Eskimos tell me there’s a herd of
walrus over about Cape Hewitt. Then we’re off for
Hudson Bay, after dropping these chaps here again.”</p>

<p>“Well, if hunting walrus isn’t any more sport than
sealing, I’ll not care for it,” announced Tom.</p>

<p>“You’ll find it very different,” the skipper assured
him. “No knocking walrus over the head.
Not a bit of it—they’re tough propositions and show
fight. You’ll have all the excitement you’re looking
for.”</p>

<p>A number of the Eskimos had come off to the
schooner in their kayaks, some of which were large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
boats with double apertures in their skin-covered
decks to accommodate two men. These were all
hoisted on to the <i>Narwhal’s</i> deck, Mr. Kemp explaining
to the boys that much of the walrus hunting was
done by the Eskimos in their frail boats.</p>

<p>Once more under way, the <i>Narwhal</i> headed westward
across Baffin Bay. As usual the lookouts
were constantly searching the sea for whales. Tom
and Jim, anxious to test their skill and having nothing
else to amuse them, also went aloft and relieved the
men, for Captain Edwards had already had a demonstration
of the boys’ keen vision when on the <i>Hector</i>
in the Antarctic. For a long time the two boys swept
the broad expanse of sparkling water in vain. Here
and there floating ice broke the blue-green surface,
rafts of big eider ducks floated lightly on the waves,
cormorants, gulls, and other birds sailed and wheeled
about and occasionally a round black head, which the
boys recognized as a seal, would break through the
surface, stare curiously at the schooner and with a
splash and a flirt of the back flippers, disappear in the
depths. But no great, shiny, black expanse of glistening
skin, no tiny fountain of spray, rose above the
rippling water and the boys drowsed at their posts.</p>

<p>Then, Jim’s sleepy eyes noted a curious looking
object upon the sea half a mile or so to the north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
At first he took it for a soggy cake of ice, but it
seemed to be moving as though carried in a swift
current. Then he decided it was a water-logged spar,
and yet it did not look just right for that either. Puzzled,
he stared and then gave a shout. Clearly from
the grayish white object a little puff of steamlike
vapor had risen.</p>

<p>“Blows!” he yelled almost unconsciously, and then,
half ashamed of his involuntary cry and realizing it
was no whale he saw, he cried out, “Come up and take
a look, Mr. Kemp.”</p>

<p>The second mate ran nimbly up the rigging, glanced
about, gazed fixedly in the direction Jim indicated,
and cupping his hands yelled down, “Beluga! ’Bout
four p’ints off the starboard bow—school of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Beluga?” exclaimed Jim as the officer started
down the shrouds. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“White whale!” replied Mr. Kemp, as he rapidly
descended to the deck.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a new one on me,” declared Jim,
yelling across to Tom. “I thought all whales were
black. Oh look, Tom! There <em>is</em> a school of the
things and—Gosh! I thought they were ice!”</p>

<p>Already the boats were being swung, and by the
time the boys reached the deck, two craft were being
lowered over the side and the men and Eskimos were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
tumbling into them. Without waiting to ask permission,
the boys leaped into one of the boats and a moment
later were speeding towards the odd whitish
creatures swimming slowly along and all unconscious
of danger.</p>

<p>As the boats drew near the whales, they spread out,
the harpooniers laid aside their oars and stood in
the bows with irons in hand, and in a moment more
were within striking distance of the creatures. Almost
at the same instant the various harpoons darted
forward, and as the keen points of the irons buried
themselves in the animals’ sides, the belugas leaped
half from the water, looking to the boys’ wondering
eyes far more like gigantic white seals than whales.
Then, with a rush, the creatures started off, towing
the boats at a terrific rate through the water, turning
and twisting, sounding and milling, sometimes leaping
high in air, at other times rolling over and over,
and striving by a hundred unexpected moves to rid
themselves of the stinging weapons in their sides.
As Tom said afterwards, it was like playing enormous
trout, for the men alternately hauled in or let out the
line; they laughed and shouted and yelled as if
thoroughly enjoying the sport and there was none of
the tense strained attitude that the boys had seen when
attacking the bowheads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>But the fight did not last long. Within fifteen minutes
from being struck the white whale was tired out.
He rested almost motionless, blowing frequently; and,
hauling in the line hand over hand, as the crew urged
the boat forward, the men drew the craft close to the
big, dirty-white creature. An instant later the long,
keen-bladed lance flashed, the stricken whale threw
its head high in air, thrashed madly with its tail,
and rolled slowly over on its side in the reddening
water.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t much of a fight!” exclaimed Tom as
the boat was run alongside the dead beluga and the
fluke chain was made fast.</p>

<p>“Never do give much of a tussle,” said Mr. Kemp,
“they ain’t much more’n second-rate whales anyhow.
No bigger’n blackfish.”</p>

<p>Towing the dead whale, the boat pulled toward the
schooner and a few minutes later the other three boats
came in, each with his white, twenty-foot carcass bobbing
along behind it. Then for the first time, the
boys saw that the Eskimos were also out in their
big kayaks and were paddling furiously over the
waves in pursuit of the remaining belugas. Running
into the rigging the boys watched the Eskimos through
their glasses. They saw the foremost paddler in the
nearest kayak urge his skin craft among the speeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
whales; the man in the forward seat raised his
arm, there was a flash as a harpoon sped through
the air, and the next moment a huge, dark-colored,
balloon-shaped object was bobbing up and down,
dashing this way and that where the beluga had
been, while the kayak paddled off in another direction.</p>

<p>“Gee, he missed him!” cried Tom. “And say,
what on earth is that thing on the water?”</p>

<p>“Search me!” replied Jim. “Golly, there’s three
more of ’em. And not a single kayak is fast to a
whale. Let’s ask about it.”</p>

<p>Hurrying to the deck the boys approached Captain
Edwards. “Oh, Captain,” cried Tom, “what are
those big round things out there by the Eskimos’
kayaks? And how is it not a single kayak is fast to
a whale? Those fellows must be dubs not to get
fast when they’re right among the whales.”</p>

<p>The skipper roared with laughter. “Dubs!” he
exclaimed. “Why, my boys, I’ll warrant not a Eskimo
missed gettin’ fast. But of course you don’t
understand. Them things you see a-bobbin’ about
yonder are floats—skin bladders, and fast to the Eskimos’
irons in the whales. They don’t risk their
kayaks a-gettin’ fas’, but jus’ let the whales tire ’emselves
out a-towin’ the buoys ’round and meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
go after other critters. They’ll bring ’em all in,
don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>“Well, we <em>have</em> got a lot to learn,” remarked Jim
turning away. “Look, Tom, there comes a kayak
now, and—yes, they’re towing two whales.”</p>

<p>Interestedly the two boys watched the approaching
Eskimos, and one after another, the kayaks came paddling
alongside, each towing one or more belugas.
By the time all were alongside the schooner, twelve
white whales were floating under the vessel’s lee and
the crew were working like beavers cutting in the dull
white creatures. The work was easy and rapid compared
with cutting in the bowheads or a sperm whale,
for the belugas were tiny creatures compared with
the other monsters the boys had seen.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours after first sighting the
school, the last of the catch had been cast adrift, and
the <i>Narwhal</i> was again sailing westward toward Baffin
Island and the walrus grounds.</p>

<p>Elated at their success in sighting the white whales,
the two boys ran up the rigging to their places on the
crosstrees. Scarcely had Tom glanced about when
his shout of, “She blows!” rang out. Barely a mile
ahead a sparkling jet of vapor had risen above the
sea, and an instant later a stupendous body had
broken the surface, gleaming like polished metal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the sun. Cataracts of water poured from it. Tom
fairly gasped at the size of the creature, and his voice
was shaking with excitement as he yelled back, “a
point off the port bow, about a mile away,” in response
to the Captain’s call of, “Where away?”</p>

<p>“It’s the biggest whale ever!” he cried excitedly
to the officers as he reached the deck. “Say, we <em>will</em>
have a fight with him!”</p>

<p>Captain Edwards chuckled. “I’ll bet we would—if
we gave him a chance,” he replied. “But we
ain’t a-goin’ to meddle with that critter.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’re not going after him?” cried
Tom in wondering tones. “Why, why, he’d give
over a hundred barrels!”</p>

<p>“Don’t doubt it,” smiled the skipper, “but he can
keep it under his blamed old hide for all of us.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you’re afraid to tackle him?” demanded
the puzzled boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp and Cap’n Pem burst into a roar of
laughter. “Yes and no,” declared the second officer,
“that’s a finback.”</p>

<p>“Finback!” exclaimed Jim. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Consarndest critters there be,” declared Cap’n
Pem. “Ef ye wanter git stove or kilt or towed ter
kingdom come, jes go in on a finback. ’Course I
ain’t skeered o’ doin’ of it—never seed a whale yit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
thet skeered me, but shucks, what’s the use? Derned
critters’ll tow ye nigh fifty mile ’fore ye kin lance ’em
an’ fight like Sam Hill. An’ arter ye’ve druv home
the lance, ef yer boat ain’t smashed ter kindlin’ wood,
an’ ye ain’t kilt, the consarned critter’s jes mean an
onderhanded enough fer to sink.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t touch them!” exclaimed Tom.
“Gosh, it seems a shame to let such big fellows go.
Aren’t they ever killed?”</p>

<p>“Steam whalers—Scotch and Skowhegians take
’em,” replied Mr. Kemp. “But you got to have
harpoon guns and bomb lances and three inch cables
and steam winches to get ’em.”</p>

<p>By now the whale which had been the subject of
the conversation was within plain view from the deck,
and the boys fairly gasped as they noted its enormous
size. An instant later it had caught sight of the
schooner and in a swirl of foam sounded and disappeared.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re still learning,” laughed Tom. “I
always thought whales were whales, but I know now
that there are whales <em>and</em> whales.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WALRUS HUNT</span></h2>

<p>Hour after hour the <i>Narwhal</i> sailed steadily
on, and ever as she proceeded, the floating
ice and lofty drifting bergs grew larger
and more numerous. When the shores of Baffin Island
at last rose above the sea, the water was only
visible as narrow lanes of green amid the wide
stretch of rough ice. How the schooner could ever
get through the vast field with its bobbing close-packed
cakes and its towering bergs, was a mystery
to the boys. They watched intently as old Cap’n
Pem, now in charge as ice pilot, bawled out quick,
sharp orders, and at his commands, the helm was
shifted, yards were swung and sails trimmed instantly
as the <i>Narwhal</i> tacked and turned and twisted and
threaded her devious way through the narrow leads.
Often after the schooner’s passage, the ice, disturbed
by her wake, would drift across the channels, and soon
the boys, looking astern, could see nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
vast field of ice showing no sign of the open water by
which they had entered.</p>

<p>Here, too, the boys saw why the topsail schooner
was such a favorite with Arctic whalemen. To be
sure, Cap’n Pem had already explained it to them
when they had first discussed the <i>Narwhal’s</i> rig, but
until they actually saw it demonstrated they did not
fully realize how handy the rig was amid the ice.
Often, as the vessel plunged forward along a narrow
lead, the passage would end in an impenetrable barrier,
and the boys held their breaths as the schooner
seemed about to dash into the mass of ice. But each
time the old whaleman’s voice would roar out an
order. The men, ready at sheets and braces, would
bend to the ropes and, as the huge topsail yard swung
about, the <i>Narwhal</i> would slow down, hesitate, and at
the very instant the boys expected to hear the splintering
of ice and the crashing of shivered planking, the
schooner would begin to move backward. But at last
the leads became so narrow, so tortuous and so
choked with ice that Cap’n Pem declared they could
go no farther.</p>

<p>“Reckon we’d better be gettin’ out ice anchors, an’
lyin’ here till she opens up,” he declared, addressing
Captain Edwards. “Soon’s wind or tide changes,
the derned ice’ll begin ter move.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Humph, and take us with it, like as not,” responded
the skipper. “Never did see such a lot of
ice ’long here this time o’ year. And time’s flyin’.
If she don’t open up mighty quick, we’ll have to put
about and make for the Straits or we won’t be a-gettin’
into the Bay this season.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you run in with the motor?” asked Tom.
“Seems to me that’s easier to handle than sails.”</p>

<p>“By glory! I must be gettin’ old,” cried the
captain. “Say, Pem, what sort of a’ ice pilot are you
that you didn’t think of that?”</p>

<p>“How in tarnation’d I think o’ thet there contraption?”
demanded the old whaleman. “Fust time I
ever wuz shipmates long o’ one.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the motor’s exhaust was ringing
loudly across the ice pack, and under half speed,
the schooner was cautiously feeling her way through
the zigzagging, winding lanes of water; bumping into
floating cakes, grating against the solid masses on
either side, but each moment getting farther and
farther into the vast field and nearer to the gray
rocky coast. Presently, from the lookout came the
shout of “Open water ahead!” An hour later the
<i>Narwhal</i> was resting at anchor in a broad expanse of
open sea with only isolated grounded bergs and
drifting floes upon the surface. Seaward, the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
barrier through which she had passed stretched to the
horizon to north and south.</p>

<p>Hardly had the schooner come to rest before the
Eskimos were launching their kayaks, and in a few
minutes were darting away in various directions.</p>

<p>“Where are they going?” asked Tom as he and
Jim watched the skin boats leave the vessel’s side.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for walrus,” replied the captain. “When
they sight a herd they’ll come back and report and
like as not get a few to bring along as samples.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to be with them,” declared Jim. “I’m
going to ask Unavik to take us in a kayak some day.”</p>

<p>“Better start with a real boat,” advised the captain.
“If you see a big bull walrus rearin’ up his head
and glarin’ at you with them red eyes of his, and
roarin’ and bellowin’ and heavin’ his tusks up and
down, and rushin’ at you like he’s gone crazy, you’ll
be mighty glad you’re in a whaleboat ’stead of a skin
kayak.”</p>

<p>“Whew, are they like that?” cried Tom. “They
look so big and clumsy in the pictures and when
they’re stuffed, that I didn’t suppose they could really
do much harm.”</p>

<p>“Wussedest critters I know,” declared Cap’n Pem,
“and ye wouldn’t git me fer to hunt ’em in them there
cockleshells o’ kayaks, not fer nothin’. With a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
musket an’ a whaleboat ’tain’t so bad, but a bull
walrus ain’t to be sneezed at, lemme tell ye!”</p>

<p>“All the more excitement,” laughed Tom. “I’m
just crazy to go after them!”</p>

<p>“Guess ye mus’ be crazy to wanter,” muttered old
Pem. “But long’s ye’re out fer to git adventure an’
own the consarned ol’ ship, there ain’t a mite o’ use
my tellin’ ye not to.”</p>

<p>Jim laughed. “You know perfectly well you
wouldn’t let us go and neither would Captain Edwards,
if there was any real danger,” he said.</p>

<p>“There’s always danger on a whaler in the Arctic,”
said the skipper, “but you two boys know how to
shoot and ain’t reckless, and Kemp’s an old hand,
and there ain’t any likelihood of your gettin’ hurt, in
a good boat.”</p>

<p>“But there’s that there cat——” began Pem.</p>

<p>“Oh nonsense!” interrupted Tom. “If we go,
we’re going to take that cat with us as a mascot.”</p>

<p>“Waall, fools <em>will</em> rush in, ye knows,” muttered
the old whaleman as he stumped aft.</p>

<p>While waiting for the Eskimos to return with word
as to the whereabouts of the walrus herd, the boats
were lowered, the masts stepped, guns and other appliances
and weapons stowed, and all prepared in
readiness for the hunt. At last, after several hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
wait, the boys spied the kayaks returning. As they
drew near, Tom and Jim saw that the two leading
craft were towing some huge object. Grasping the
glasses, Tom ran up the rigging. “They’ve found
them!” he cried out an instant later. “They’re bringing
in the ‘sample’ just as the captain said.”</p>

<p>“How they can get a walrus and tow him in with
those kyaks gets me,” declared Jim.</p>

<p>“Trust those boys to do it though,” said Mr. Kemp.
“Why, they even get big bowheads in kayaks. They
can handle them canoes to beat all. I’ve seen
’em flop clean over and come up a smilin’ t’other
side.”</p>

<p>Tom laughed. “You must think we’re greener
than we are, to swallow that,” he declared.</p>

<p>The second officer grinned. “All right, I’ll prove
it,” he announced, and calling to a young Eskimo who
stood near, he said something to him in the fellow’s
own language.</p>

<p>With a broad grin the Eskimo slipped over the
schooner’s rail, settled himself in the tiny craft,
pulled the string of the lacing to the circular opening
about his body, and with a few strokes of his
paddle drew away from the <i>Narwhal</i>.</p>

<p>“Now watch him!” exclaimed Mr. Kemp.</p>

<p>Glancing up at the watching boys, the Eskimo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
waved his hand, gave a sudden lurch to one side, and
to the boys’ utter amazement, the kayak capsized. The
next instant they could see only the smooth rounded
bottom of the canoe.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be drowned!” cried Tom. “He’s laced
in and can’t——”</p>

<p>Before he could finish the sentence, the kayak had
rotated, and scarcely believing their eyes, the boys
saw the craft bob right side up with its swarthy occupant
still grinning.</p>

<p>“Well, that <em>is</em> a stunt!” cried Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, I take it all back,” said Tom. “I’ll believe
any yarn you tell us after that.”</p>

<p>Over and over again the Eskimo performed the
feat for the boys’ benefit, and then, the walrus hunters
approaching, he darted off and joined them.</p>

<p>As the kayaks came alongside, the boys looked with
wonder at the enormous creature they had in tow—a
huge bull walrus, partly supported by air-filled skin
floats, and with gleaming white tusks nearly two feet
in length.</p>

<p>Swarming on to the schooner, the Eskimos all began
chattering at once in a mixture of broken English,
Danish, and their own tongue, until Captain Edwards
threw up his hands in despair. “Here, Mr. Kemp,”
he called, “come and get this. I can savvy a bit o’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the lingo, but this is too much for me. They’re worse
nor a flock o’ poll-parrots!”</p>

<p>The second officer pushed his way through the
group, uttered a few sharp words in the Eskimos’
dialect, and instantly all ceased talking. Then, turning
to a man who appeared to be a leader, he asked
him a question. Rapidly and with sparkling eyes the
fellow replied, and Mr. Kemp turned to the skipper.
“Says there’s a whoppin’ big herd of walrus over to
Lewis’ Inlet,” he announced. “’Cordin’ to him,
must be pretty nigh two hundred of the critters.
Leastwise, he says ‘twenty pair of hands of ’em’ and
that’s all the same as two hundred. Says they’re
well up on land and easy to cut off from water.
They picked the bull up outside on a cake of
ice.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the captain. “Man the boats
and get started. Guess you’ll need pretty near all
hands. Swanson’s been after walrus afore, he tells
me, and I guess Pem and Mike and two or three of the
men can take care of the ship. I’ll go along in one
boat, you take another, Swanson can take the third
and—hmm, Mr. Chester, you’re to take the fourth
boat!”</p>

<p>For a moment Tom did not realize that the captain
was addressing him, and then, as it dawned upon him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
“Wha—what’s that?” he stammered. “You don’t
mean——”</p>

<p>“That you’re in charge of the port after-boat,” interrupted
the skipper with a twinkle in his eye. “You
can take Mr. Lathrop as mate if you wish. Might as
well learn how to handle a boat now as ever.”</p>

<p>“Gee Whitaker!” exclaimed the dazed boy as he
and Jim dashed to their cabin for their rifles. “I’m
as nervous as a cat! Of course I can steer the boat—with
the rudder and under sail; but I don’t know what
to do when we get to the walrus.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just do like the others do,” advised Jim.
“Gosh, I’d like to have your chance! Say, you’ll be
a regular boat steerer next! Besides, Captain Edwards
will probably tell you what to do when we get
near.”</p>

<p>But despite Jim’s encouraging words, Tom’s knees
were shaky as he took his place in the boat assigned
him, slipped the rudder in place, and sat waiting the
captain’s order to cast off.</p>

<p>“When you get near the herd, spread out,” directed
Captain Edwards, “and go in as near the same
time as you can. Pick the biggest bulls and aim
for the ear or neck close to the head. Take them
that’s near the water first, and if one of ’em comes
for you, keep off and shoot him. Don’t take no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
chances—a bull walrus can stave a boat’s easy as a
egg shell.”</p>

<p>A moment later the boats were cast off, sails were
trimmed, and the little fleet went dancing across the
calm sea, each boat towing several kayaks with their
Eskimo occupants behind it.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they approached the shore. The
schooner was a mere speck in the distance, and the
captain’s boat, guided by a wrinkled old Eskimo,
swung more towards the south. Presently they
passed a jutting, rocky cape, about whose shores the
drift ice was piled high, and entered a tiny bottle-shaped
bay. And at the sight which greeted them,
the boys exclaimed in wonder.</p>

<p>Everywhere upon the shingle and the grounded
cakes of ice were the bulky, dull-brown, clumsy-looking
walrus. There were scores—hundreds of the
creatures. Giant bulls with enormous, wrinkled,
warty-skinned necks and gleaming ivory tusks;
smaller, light-colored cows, and little seal-like pups.
The pups and cows were some distance from the
water’s edge, the younger bulls were scattered in
groups near by and along the shore. Resting on
rocks or ice cakes with their tiny heads raised high,
were the old veterans of a thousand fights, the giant,
scarred, elephantine bulls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly, as with one accord, sails were lowered,
the kayaks were cast off and, under oars and paddles,
the fleet of boats and canoes swept upon the herd.
For a moment the bulls stared wonderingly at the
unexpected visitors. Then a low, growling, barking
roar echoed across the bay. The great creatures
wheeled about to face the intruders and, shaking their
tusked heads threateningly, prepared to defend the
cows and their young.</p>

<p>The next instant, rifles and muskets roared. The
boys glimpsed several big bulls as they swayed and
sank lifeless. They heard the shouts of the excited
men, the shriller cries of the Eskimos, and then forgot
all else as their boat approached a gigantic bull
walrus who had dragged himself to the very verge of
an ice cake, and was on the point of diving into the
sea. Taking careful aim, Jim fired; but at the very
instant he pulled the trigger, the boat lurched, his
rifle wavered, and the bull with a roar plunged with
a tremendous splash into the water.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I missed!” cried Jim.</p>

<p>“There’s another!” screamed Tom. “Get him!”</p>

<p>Once more Jim’s rifle crashed out and a smaller
bull sagged like an empty sack upon the shingle.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Tom, and then his glad shout
died on his lips and he screamed a warning filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
terror. Within two feet of the boat—so close he
could have touched it with his outstretched hand—a
great, ferocious-looking head had burst from the
water, the tiny, wicked eyes gleaming like those of an
enraged elephant, the stiff, horny whiskers bristling,
the two-foot yellow tusks dripping blood from a deep
gash across the forehead where Jim’s bullet had cut
its way.</p>

<p>Wounded, mad with fury, the walrus reared its
massive neck above the water and hurled itself at
the boat. Frantically Tom yelled. The men seized
the oars and struggled desperately to swing the boat.
Jim hastily reloaded and strove to shoot. But the
boat was swaying and tipping to the men’s efforts and
Jim could not aim. Almost before they realized
their peril, the boys saw the maddened creature’s head
raised above the edge of the boat. With a tremendous
blow, the long tusks came crashing down, splintering
the thwart, breaking the stout oak rail and bearing
the boat down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>Instantly the men threw themselves to the opposite
side of the craft. With oars, clubs and whatever
they could grasp they rained a shower of blows upon
the animal’s head, but they might as well have struck
at a helmet of steel. With blood pouring from the
wounds, but not affected by them in the least, the bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
walrus lashed the water into a maelstrom of froth,
wrenched his head back and forth, bellowed with
rage, and swung the heavy thirty-foot boat from side
to side and up and down as though it were a thing of
paper. Excited, rattled, terror-stricken, Tom was
paralyzed with fear, and neither he nor any of his
men realized that their antagonist was striving with
might and main to tear free his tusks wedged in
the splintered wood; that, with his head thus held as
in a trap, he could not lift himself high enough to
withdraw his tusks, and that he was in reality almost
as terrorized as the occupants of the boat. Owing
to some mistake, none of the old hands were in Tom’s
boat. Not a member of his crew had ever before
seen a live walrus, much less an infuriated wounded
one. They were so thoroughly frightened by the
creature’s sudden and savage onslaught, that they
completely lost their heads.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly and with a wild shout, one-eyed
Ned leaped forward, seized a boat spade and, yelling
like a fiend and holding the weapon as though it
were a bayonet, he plunged the keen-edged spade
time after time into the thick, wrinkled neck of
the walrus. The sea turned crimson, the walrus
lashed the water into scarlet foam. Gradually
his struggles ceased, his eyes closed, and he lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
dead, with his tusks still locked over the boat’s rail.</p>

<p>But the danger was not over. The inert, heavy
body tipped the craft until every wave lapped over
the side, and while several men struggled and heaved
and tugged to lift the creature’s head free, the others
bailed for their lives, but seemingly to no purpose.
Not only was the buoyancy of the boat pressing upwards
against the weight of the walrus, but the tusks
were driven so firmly through the thwart that they
were locked as though in a vise. Each second it
seemed as if the boat would fill and all would be
struggling in the icy water.</p>

<p>Their shouts and cries had attracted the attention
of the other boats and Swanson, who was nearest,
had come racing to Tom’s aid. Before his boat was
alongside, the battle was over, however, and seeing the
trouble, the cooper and several of his men leaped into
Tom’s boat and with their weight on the upper side,
the water ceased to come in. Then Tom, suddenly
remembering his responsibility, recovered his scattered
wits. “Here!” he shouted. “Get the handle
of an oar under his head and pry him loose!” But
even with the stout handle of the heavy ash oar as a
lever, the walrus’ head could not be budged.</p>

<p>“Get the hatchet and cut away the thwart!” ordered
Tom. As the keen-edged little ax cut through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
splintered wood, the men heaved up on the oar, and
with a splash the animal’s head slipped over the rail
into the sea.</p>

<p>Swanson stood up, pulled at his huge mustache,
drew his pipe from his pocket and commenced to fill
it with a blunt, blackened forefinger. “Ay tank you
bane have close shave,” he remarked, as he glanced
about. “By yiminy, you bane pretty near cut das
fellow head off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say we had a close shave!” exclaimed Tom.
“And if it hadn’t been for Ned we’d all have been
drowned or killed. Gee, I’d have hated to be overboard
with that beast. Ned was the only one who
kept his head.”</p>

<p>The big Swede nodded approvingly, squinted his
pale blue eyes and turned his gaze curiously on the
ex-soldier.</p>

<p>“Ay tank mebbe das glass eye he got more better
as two some fellers got. He bane gude fellow, Ned,”
he declared gravely.</p>

<p>“Aw, forget it!” exclaimed the one-eyed veteran
flushing. “I didn’t do nothin’. The bloomin’ beast’s
face was so darned like that of a Hun what stuck his
ugly mug into my dugout over there, that I plumb
forgot myself an’ went at him with a bay’net same’s
if he was a Heinie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if that was a sample of the way you went
after the Germans, I’m sorry for them!” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“Vell, Ay tank Ay bane goin’ back,” remarked
Swanson as he scrambled into his own boat. “Yumpin
yiminy! Das bane vun big bull you get!”</p>

<p>Now that the excitement was over, the boys glanced
about. No more walruses were to be seen ashore.
The rocks and ice were deserted save for a half dozen
dead bulls and a couple of badly wounded ones. A
few cows could be seen swimming some distance
away. The other boats’ crews were busy working at
the kill. The Eskimos, however, were paddling furiously
about and the interested boys saw the forward
man in the nearest kayak lunge forward with his harpoon
as a bull walrus broke water.</p>

<p>“Golly, if that fellow goes for ’em they’ll be sunk!”
exclaimed Jim.</p>

<p>But the Eskimos gave the stricken and angry creature
no chance. As with a snort of rage he broke
the surface and charged the kayak, the tiny craft
whirled as on a pivot, dodged the oncoming creature
and, as it passed by him, the Eskimo in the bow
leaned over and drove a long lance into the
animal’s neck. Over and over again the maneuver
was repeated. Fascinated the boys and men watched
this battle between the wounded, infuriated bull walrus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and the frail craft of skin, with its Eskimo occupants
armed with their primitive weapons. But, as
always, brains and intelligence triumphed, and presently
the grinning natives were paddling toward
shore, towing the carcass of their victim behind them.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">UNAVIK SPINS A YARN</span></h2>

<p>Many days had passed since the boys’ first
walrus hunt. They had learned much by
experience and had killed many of the
enormous ugly creatures without mishap. They had
retained the skull of that first huge bull as a trophy,
and no walrus taken since had approached it in the
length and beauty of the perfectly matched and
pointed tusks. Tom, to his unspeakable delight, had
been made boat steerer and had been assigned to the
same craft in which they had battled with the walrus
and Jim, not to be outdone, had bent every energy to
acquiring skill in using the harpoon and lance.</p>

<p>In this Cap’n Pem had played an important part,
and finding the regular irons far too heavy for the
boy, he had had the blacksmith fashion some special
lighter weapons for Jim’s private use. Jim was as
proud as a peacock of these and kept them, sharpened
to a razor edge and carefully sheathed and greased, in
the bow of the boat. And when, one day, two white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
whales were sighted and Tom’s boat drew into one of
the creatures, and Jim had his first chance to test his
skill, he was trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>Standing in the bow, bracing himself in the knee
cleat, the boy raised his iron, and as the huge beluga
broke water close by, he heaved the iron with all
his strength. A roar of approval came booming
across the waves from Cap’n Pem as the weapon
struck fair and buried itself in the white whale’s back.
All by themselves the boys and their crew played the
stricken creature and by Tom’s orders the men
worked as the line was hauled or slackened. When
at last the white whale lay tired upon the sea, the boat
drew close, and Jim killed the beluga with a single
stroke of his lance. Then indeed, the two boys felt
that they were full-fledged whalemen and they longed
for the time when they could go on a real whale, a
bowhead, and fight the thrilling, exciting, dangerous
battle with a monster of the deep and bring him “fin
up” unaided.</p>

<p>But no bowheads were seen, and the boys were
forced to content themselves with lesser game. They
had learned to handle the kayaks, and under Unavik’s
tutelage they had become quite expert with the ticklish
skin-covered craft. Often they had paddled
ashore and, armed with rifle and shotgun, had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hunting in the rocky hills or over the tundra, but they
had seen neither bear, musk ox, reindeer, or other
large game. But they invariably returned with full
bags, for ducks, plover, geese and swan, as well as
the big Arctic hares, were everywhere, and those on
the <i>Narwhal</i> never suffered for lack of fresh meat.
Once too, Jim had spied a grayish shape skulking
along a hollow several hundred yards away and taking
careful aim had brought it down at his first
shot.</p>

<p>“Gee, I guess it’s some Eskimo’s dog!” he exclaimed
when the two boys reached the creature and
saw a gaunt, pale, grayish yellow, doglike animal
lying among the rocks and sparse grass.</p>

<p>“Well it’s got a good hide anyway,” said Tom.
“We’ll skin it and take it along. It’ll make a nice
rug when we get home.”</p>

<p>But when, on reaching the schooner, they exhibited
the skin, and Mr. Kemp told them they had killed
a huge wolf, the boys fairly gasped with astonishment
and then danced and yelled with delight.</p>

<p>Another time, Tom had killed a beautiful blue fox
as the creature raced away from a half-devoured
young Canada goose, and in a pen on the forward
deck, they had a miniature menagerie of young ducks,
geese, swans, gulls, and other birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now late summer and the young birds of the
year were able to take care of themselves, but when
the boys had first gone ashore on their hunts, ducks,
geese, and other wild fowl were nesting by thousands
in every hollow and swale.</p>

<p>It was on their first trip that Jim had an amusing
experience, and for months afterwards Tom and the
ship’s officers never ceased teasing him about it. The
two boys were strolling across a little vale, a spot
carpeted with deep reindeer moss and stunted bushes,
when, from almost under Jim’s feet, a duck fluttered
away apparently unable to take wing. Leaping forward
to grasp it Jim’s foot tripped and he plunged
headlong into the bushes. There was a crunching
crash beneath him and, as he regained his feet, Tom
fairly doubled up with uncontrollable laughter.
From chest to waist Jim was drenched with a sticky
yellow mass dotted with broken and crushed bluish
egg shells. He had fallen squarely upon the duck’s
nest!</p>

<p>“Oh you <em>are</em> a sight!” choked Tom. “Gosh, you
certainly did find that nest, Jim!”</p>

<p>Jim looked ruefully at the dripping mess and without
a smile exclaimed: “Gee, I like eggs, but I
don’t like ’em scrambled that way!”</p>

<p>The story was too good to keep, and whenever eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
were served thereafter some one would invariably ask
Jim if he’d have his scrambled.</p>

<p>At last the signs of approaching autumn warned
Captain Edwards that they must leave the shores of
Baffin Island and speed southward to Hudson Straits
and winter quarters in Hudson Bay. Long strings of
swans and great V-shaped flocks of geese passed daily
across the sky, headed south. The vast rafts of ducks
became uneasy. The Old Squaws whistled querulously,
the eiders swam restlessly about, buffle heads
and teal winged swiftly back and forth, and the blackheads
darkened the sky with their veering, ever-turning
flocks. The plover lost their black waistcoats
and took on silvery white ones; the snow bunting became
gray and white; the ptarmigan were dotted with
white feathers among their soft brown plumage and
the Arctic hares grew paler and paler as they gradually
assumed their winter coats to match the spotless
snow. The days grew shorter, the sun disappeared
below the horizon, and the Aurora glowed and
flashed and scintillated in tongues and bands of
lambent hues across the zenith. The wind was chill
with the feel of frost and ice as it swept across the
land which now showed hardly a tint of green or a
speck of the scarlet, blue and yellow that had formerly
decked the hillsides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>So, with many casks of oils, great piles of walrus
hides, bundles of sealskins, sacks stuffed full of eider
feathers, and many hundred pounds of walrus ivory
in her hold, the <i>Narwhal</i> picked and felt her way out
through the leads among the ice pack and into the
broad waters of Baffin Bay. To the strong and biting
wind her sails were spread, and across the short
sharp waves with their spiteful hissing caps of foam,
the schooner plunged towards Disko Bay. Here the
Eskimos were landed laden with axes, powder and
lead, cloth, brass, and gee-gaws as their wages. Then
with yards braced sharp up and sheets close hauled,
the <i>Narwhal</i> buried her blunt nose deep in the tumbling
foam, and with lee rail awash sped southward
for the entrance to Hudson Straits.</p>

<p>Twice bowheads were sighted and boats lowered;
but to the boys’ chagrin and disappointment, Captain
Edwards absolutely refused to let them go in on the
giant creatures without an experienced man in charge,
for the weather was squally, swirling flakes of snow
fell now and then, the sea was rough and time was
precious.</p>

<p>At last, the entrance to the Straits was reached.
Passing Resolution Island close to windward and with
a fair wind, the <i>Narwhal</i> sped through. Slipping
swiftly past Coats Island and through the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Fisher Strait with big Southampton Island on the
north, she headed for Rowe’s Welcome, where Captain
Edwards planned to pass the long and dreary
Arctic winter.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Tom as the boys gazed across
the vast expanse of the bay. “This is like the ocean.
I thought Hudson Bay was just like a big lake.”</p>

<p>Captain Edwards chuckled. “Mighty big lake!”
he laughed. “About six hundred miles wide and a
thousand miles long—big enough to drop all New
England into it and just make a little island about the
size of Southampton yonder. And did you know
we could go on sailing and come out over north’ard of
Alaska—that is, if the ice’d let us?”</p>

<p>“No, I never did,” admitted Tom. “I wish geographies
taught us all these things. We learn that
Lake Superior is awfully big but they never say much
about these out-of-the-way places.”</p>

<p>“Well, Superior’s a pretty sizable pond,” declared
the skipper. “But it’s just a puddle ’longside
this bay. Why, from James Bay to the north’ard
point of Melville Peninsula’s as far as acrost the
Atlantic at the mouth of the St. Lawrence; and from
Nottingham Island at the end of the Straits to the
Seal River, t’other side of the bay, it’s as far as from
New York to Chicago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whew, I guess I’ll have to remember that and tell
the boys at home,” said Jim. “Are there whales in
here?”</p>

<p>“Whales!” exclaimed the skipper. “One of the
best grounds I know. If this weather holds out we’ll
get a heap of ile afore ice begins to make.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem who stood near shook his head dolefully.
“Too consarned good fer to las’,” he declared.
“Li’ble to come down a rip-snortin’ mos’ anny minnet.
Storm breeder’s what I calls it. Yes, sir. Feels
like summer now, but I’ll bet ye we ketch it afore we
git to the Welcome.”</p>

<p>It was, as the old whaleman said, “too good to last”—a
soft, warm day with a blue sky, a calm sea barely
ruffled by the light southerly wind, and altogether
like an Indian Summer day in New England. But to
the experienced eye of the old whaleman there were
many signs that the weather would not last and that
something was wrong. The ducks, that had been
winging southward, huddled together, raised their
heads uneasily and gabbled ceaselessly. The V-shaped
flocks of geese were mere specks in the sky,
and their hoarse honks came faintly through the air.
The gulls uttered raucous cries and wheeled and
screamed. Little knots of auks and guillemots kept
rising from the waves, heading on rapidly moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wings for the craggy shores. The sun had a pale,
hazy appearance while about it was a huge ring of
light, like the ghost of a rainbow.</p>

<p>Lighter and lighter became the wind. It fell to
a flat calm, the water was smooth as oil and the <i>Narwhal</i>
drifted idly. Then the boys noticed that the
vast bulk of Southampton Island seemed to be fading
away, the farther shores of the bay were becoming
faint and blue. Almost before they realized what
it meant, the air grew suddenly chill, a cold wind
whipped against their faces and, like a gray blanket,
the fog descended swiftly, unheralded, and wrapped
schooner and bay in its dense gray folds.</p>

<p>“Knowed sutthin’ wuz a-comin’ out o’ this,” declared
Cap’n Pem. “Bust it all, why couldn’t she
’a’ held off ’til we got inter the Welcome?”</p>

<p>“What on earth <em>is</em> this ‘Welcome’ you’re always
speaking of?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Shucks, ’course ye don’t know,” replied the old
whaleman. “Why, a Welcome’s a sort o’ harbor-bay
like, where a ship kin put in an’ be snug an’ safe from
ice jams an’ win’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good name for such places,” laughed
Tom. “I suppose the first people who found them
called them that because they were so welcome.”</p>

<p>“Yep, I reckon so,” assented Pem. “But this here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
blasted fog ain’t welcome, an’ like as not it’ll come
on cold and blow harder’n blazes fer a week arter
it lifts. I knowed that there cat’d play the everlastin’
fumdiddles with us.”</p>

<p>The fog was now so dense that only a few feet of
the deck and bulwarks were visible about the spot
where one stood. The water although so near was
completely hidden and looking down into the greenish
gray vapor, the ship seemed floating in air. From
every side came the whimpering cries of gulls, the
querulous chatter of ducks, the honk of geese, and
the shrill notes of other birds. Presently Unavik
loomed silently close to the boys and leaning upon
the rail peered into the fog.</p>

<p>“H’lo!” he greeted the two. “Plenty fog, me say.
Me t’ink Ukla bus’ dis day.”</p>

<p>“What <em>are</em> you talking about?” queried Jim.
“What’s ‘Ukla,’ and what do you mean by its busting?’”</p>

<p>The Eskimo grinned. “Gimme t’bac, me say
you,” he replied.</p>

<p>So accustomed had the boys become to Unavik’s
inevitable requests for tobacco, that they always carried
a plug or two in their pockets, and so, at the
Eskimo’s request, Jim handed him the coveted weed.</p>

<p>“Reckon he’s goin’ to spin a Eskimo yarn,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Mr. Kemp, who stepped like a phantom from
the surrounding mist. “These boys is full of stories—have
one to account for blamed near everything.
Some of ’em mighty good, too.”</p>

<p>Unavik grinned, tore a huge mouthful of tobacco
from the plug with his strong white teeth and, having
masticated it for a moment, began to speak. It was
not difficult for the boys to understand him, for they
had become familiar with his bizarre English. They
listened intently to his tale which, without Unavik’s
dialect, was as follows:</p>

<p>“Many, many winters ago,” commenced the Eskimo,
“there was one great white bear named Ukla.
He and his wife lived many days’ travel towards the
west in a great skin house on a rocky plain, and all
about the house were the skulls of men and women,
for Ukla and his wife ate people’s flesh, and every
night he traveled across the land to the Eskimo villages.
Then he would kill any one he found outside
the huts, and if he could not do this, he would steal
the bodies of the dead and fastening a thong about
their feet, would drag them to his home.</p>

<p>“Sometimes he was seen by the Eskimos, but oftener
the people saw only his giant footmarks in the
snow, or found the graves opened and the dead gone.
For many years old Ukla did this, and although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Eskimos held medicine feasts and asked the Great
Spirit to help them, no help came.</p>

<p>“Many times also the people lay in wait and tried
to kill Ukla, the giant bear, with their spears and
arrows, but Ukla was a great <i>anticoot</i> (magician) and
the weapons fell from his shaggy skin bent or broken.
Then one day a stranger came to the Eskimos—a
tall fair man, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Take heart, for I will destroy Ukla.’</p>

<p>“Then the Eskimos danced and beat their drums
and were happy, and the stranger said to them: ‘To-morrow
I will pretend to be dead, and you must wrap
me in skins and bury me among the stones; and when
Ukla comes let him take me away in peace.’</p>

<p>“Then the people were sad, but the stranger said:
‘Weep not, for I will return and never again will
Ukla rob the graves or kill the people.’</p>

<p>“So the Eskimos did as the stranger told them, and
wrapping him in skins placed him among the stones
and went to their homes, crying loudly as if he had
died. In the night came the great bear who had
heard the Eskimos’ wails across the hills, and seeing
the body of the stranger, he fastened a thong about
the man’s ankles and started for his home. But the
man spread out his arms and grasped at stones and
bushes, and although Ukla pulled and tugged he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
could not travel fast, and every few miles he had to
stop and rest. Then as he looked at the man’s body
lying quiet on the ground he would shake his head in
wonder.</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ he would mutter to himself, ‘who would
think such a small man would weigh so much; but
he must be very fat and fine indeed! What a fine
supper he will make!’ Then, thinking of the fine
feast he would have, Ukla would start on again. At
last, very tired, he reached his hut, and dragging the
man inside, the bear pushed him into a corner, and
too tired to eat he crawled into his sleeping bag, telling
his wife they would feast in the morning.</p>

<p>“After a time the stranger opened his eyes to look
about, but Ukla’s wife, who was trimming the lamp,
saw him and cried out to her husband: ‘This man
is not dead—he is looking about!’</p>

<p>“But Ukla was very weary and said sleepily: ‘Oh,
man dead, man frozen stiff.’</p>

<p>“Then the man kept very still, and when the bear’s
wife turned away, he seized Ukla’s knife, and leaping
up, killed her. As she fell dead Ukla awoke, but
the man, throwing down the knife, dashed out of the
door and across the plain with the big bear at his
heels, panting and growling and snapping his teeth.</p>

<p>“At last, no matter how fast he ran, the man found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Ukla was getting nearer and nearer and would soon
overtake him. But the man was a great <i>anticoot</i>, and
as he ran he made a great hill rise between himself
and Ukla. So as the bear climbed slowly up one
side, the man raced swiftly down the other. But
when Ukla reached the top he curled up in a ball
and rolled so quickly down the hill that he almost
caught the man.</p>

<p>“Then the stranger made a big river flow between
himself and the bear, and weary with running he
seated himself on a stone to rest. When Ukla came
to the river he roared and growled in anger and in a
great voice called out: ‘How, O man did <em>you</em> cross
the river?’</p>

<p>“And the man laughed and answered, ‘I drank my
way across.’</p>

<p>“When Ukla heard this, he plunged into the water
and drank and drank until at last he made a dry path
across the river, and crawled slowly up the other
bank towards the man. But his long hair was wet
and heavy and his body was swollen with the water
he had drunk, so that the man had no fear of him
and taunted him. Then Ukla grew very angry and
with growls like icebergs clashing in a storm he
roared: ‘Ugh! even though I cannot overtake you,
yet you shall not escape me!’ and giving himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
mighty shake he burst, and the water which he had
swallowed flew in all directions and made a thick fog
over the land.</p>

<p>“Now the man was greatly troubled, for the hills
and plains could not be seen and he was lost. But
he skinned Ukla, and taking the shaggy hide in his
hands, he waved it many times about his head. This
made a great wind which drove away the fog and the
man walked safely to the Eskimo village. Then
there was great rejoicing and the men did not work
or hunt for three days, and the women did not comb
their hair for three days and three nights, but all
danced and beat drums and feasted.</p>

<p>“For many years the stranger dwelt among the people
and taught them many things, and so that the
people would always remember him, he told them
that Ukla’s spirit would roam the plains, and would
burst from time to time, and that then, as the fog
came, they must give offerings and hold medicine
dances, and that then he would know they had not
forgotten and would wave Ukla’s skin and drive away
the fog.”</p>

<p>“That is a good yarn!” cried Tom as Unavik ended.
“And say, hurrah, the fog’s lifting!”</p>

<p>Unavik grinned. “Man, he hear plenty drum.
You no hear? Me say he please an’ wave um skin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gee, I do hear drums!” declared Tom. “From
over to the west.”</p>

<p>“Sure Mike!” exclaimed Unavik. “Me say all
same. Fog go.”</p>

<p>Tom laughed. “Do you believe that yarn, Unavik?”
he asked.</p>

<p>The Eskimo stared at Tom with a puzzled expression.
“Sure,” he declared, “me see hill, me see
river, me see fog. All time fog come Eskimo make-um
plenty dance, plenty drum, fog go, all same now.”</p>

<p>As if further argument was useless in the face of
such evidence, Unavik waddled off towards the bows.</p>

<p>Presently the water was rippling against the vessel’s
sides. The fog had thinned until the entire
schooner was visible from where the boys stood. In
wisps and shreds the vapor was scudding by, while
out of the west came a strong, cold wind.</p>

<p>As the last of the fog swept by, there was a hoarse
frightened bellow from forward. Quick sharp orders
were roared out and the boys, racing to the lee side
of the schooner, fairly gasped. Almost under the
bows was a jagged reef of sharp black rocks! For
a brief instant the boys stood petrified. The schooner
seemed doomed. Before her sails could be trimmed,
before she would have steerageway upon her she
would be on the rocks. Each second she was drifting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
slipping nearer to the reef. The boys listened
with bated breath, expecting to hear the rending
crash, the awful jar that would mean the <i>Narwhal’s</i>
end.</p>

<p>All about orders were flying thick and fast. Cap’n
Pem was roaring from the break of the poop. Captain
Edwards had leaped to the wheel and was shouting
commands. Mr. Kemp in the main shrouds was
cursing the men for their slowness. Back and forth
to braces, sheets and halyards the men were rushing
and hauling in a vain effort to save the ship. Then,
from under the boys’ feet came rapid pistol-like
reports; above the cries of the men, drowning
the creak and squeal of block and sheave, barked the
exhaust of the motor; the <i>Narwhal</i> forged ahead, she
swung slowly to her rudder and, with not five feet to
spare, slid by the threatening reefs to safety.</p>

<p>With blank faces boys and men gazed at one another.
Who had saved the ship? It was not Mike,
he was stumping hurriedly aft as puzzled as any one.</p>

<p>“B’ Saint Pathrick!” he cried. “’Tis a sphirit
Oi’m thinkin’!”</p>

<p>With the boys by his side he hurried through the
cabin towards the tiny engine room where the motor
was still throbbing steadily.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” he exclaimed, as he caught sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the figure bending over the motor. “Glory be, ’tis
thot dummy av a blacksmith!”</p>

<p>“Gosh, it is!” cried Tom. “The deaf-and-dumb
man!”</p>

<p>“B’jabbers thin ’tis no dummy in his brains he
do be, at thot!” roared Mike. “B’ the powers, ’tis
lucky we do be, thot Oi tould him to be afther doin’
a bit o’ worruk on the injine.”</p>

<p>The deaf mute straightened up and stared blankly
at the three. Then, moving his fingers in an attempt
to explain matters, he shut off the motor, picked up
his kit of tools and walked forward.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’d like to know how it happened,” declared
Tom. “He couldn’t have heard the orders or excitement.
I’m going to ask Swanson.”</p>

<p>A broad grin overspread the big Swede’s features
as, in response to Tom’s questions, he interrogated
the deaf mute and watched the fellow’s fingers communicating
his reply.</p>

<p>“He say he bane fix das machine an’ he bane want
to try him out. Ay tank, by yiminy, it bane lucky
he try him yust den.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BOYS CATCH A TARTAR</span></h2>

<p>It was indeed a lucky thing for the <i>Narwhal</i> and
all upon her that the deaf-mute had been tinkering
with the motor and had started the machine
at exactly the right instant. Scarcely had the schooner
cleared the reef when, to the north, the bay was
blotted from sight by a white wall, a roar like a cataract
came booming across the water and sea birds
flew screaming past with wings aslant.</p>

<p>One glance Cap’n Pem gave and then, at the top
of his leathern lungs, he bellowed orders fast and
furiously. The men, yet at their posts, leaped to
his bidding. Captain Edwards who was still at the
wheel tugged desperately at the spokes. Mr. Kemp
himself led the willing crew aloft and, working like
demons, the men stripped the vessel of her lighter
sails. And not an instant too soon. Before the
first reef cringle was knotted in the foresail, the squall
was upon them. With a maniacal shriek the gale
tore through the rigging, the water dashed in bucketfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of icy spray across the decks, and at the sudden
irresistible pressure the <i>Narwhal</i> heeled until half
her decks were awash, and a raging blizzard blotted
out sea and land.</p>

<p>Farther and farther the staunch old schooner
heeled to the wind. Clinging to shrouds, backstays,
and rigging, the men and boys waited, expecting
each second that the schooner would actually capsize.
The sleet beat upon them, stinging like needles,
and the blinding snow swirled and eddied and piled
in drifts upon the deck.</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem’s mouth opened and shut. Mr. Kemp
cupped his hands to his lips, but not a word could
be heard above the terrific din of the howling wind,
the rattle of hail, the roaring of the gale in the sails,
the whipping of loose rigging, the creak and groans
of straining spars and the lashing thunder of the
rapidly rising seas. Then slowly, inch by inch, the
<i>Narwhal</i> swung around. Gradually she righted,
the water poured in cataracts from her scuppers and,
shaking herself like an impatient horse, she leaped
forward and tore madly through the foaming water
towards the south.</p>

<p>Onward she sped through the blizzard, before the
howling gale. With jaws hard set and eyes straining,
the three men at the wheel panted and strained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and threw their weight upon the spokes in a mighty
effort to hold her to her course. Forward, Mr. Kemp
and two men huddled in the lee of the winch and
peered ahead, striving to pierce the eddying, whirling
wall of white. The two boys, awed, frightened,
and shivering, crouched beside the deck house, too
fascinated, too thrilled to go below for warmer garments.
Twice great dim shapes loomed ahead.
Each time the frenzied shout of the lookout came
in time and the <i>Narwhal</i> sped past the bergs in safety.
Again and again a thundering crash shook the
schooner from stem to stern as her plunging bow
sheared through floating cakes of ice. Once a dark
mass of rocks loomed for an instant within a hundred
yards and the next second was gone, swallowed
up in the all-enveloping white.</p>

<p>But luck was with those on the <i>Narwhal</i>. By a
miracle she escaped the bergs; no large pan ice lay
in her course; jagged reefs and rock-bound islets
were safely passed, and an hour after she had first
started on her mad rush before the gale, the squall
ceased as suddenly as it had commenced. The wind
dropped to a steady blow, the snow ceased to fall,
blue sky showed overhead, and, ten minutes later,
the decks were streaming with water and there was a
steady downpour from aloft as the sun melted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
tons of ice and snow that had accumulated during the
brief but terrific blizzard.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell ye it’d blow a rip-snorter?” exclaimed
Cap’n Pem triumphantly, as, with sails once more
spread, the <i>Narwhal</i> turned back on her course.
“I knowed it,” he continued, “drat that there
cat!”</p>

<p>“B’gorra thin we’ll be afther havin’ foine luck fer
the rist av the cruise,” declared Mike. “Shure, the
poor puss is gone entoirely. Didn’t Oi see her with
me own eyes—washed clane overboarrd whin the old
schooner wuz afther thyrin’ for to do the lay-me-down-to-slape
stunt back there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” cried Tom. “Couldn’t you
save her?”</p>

<p>“Save her, is it!” exclaimed Mike. “Shure yez
wuz there and ’tis well yez arre afther knowin’ ’twas
a-savin’ av our own souls we wuz thinkin’ av—and
divvil a bit av the cat’s.”</p>

<p>“Derned ef I ain’t glad,” declared Pem. “Mebbe
we’ll be gittin’ on a mite better now.”</p>

<p>Mike grinned, winked an eye at the boys and, as
he turned away, remarked, “Shure, ye ould croaker,
Oi’d not be afther countin’ av me chickens afore
they do be hatched, thin. ’Tis noine loives a cat
does be afther havin’ and b’gorra by the same token<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
she’ll be a-comin’ back and be a-drowndin’ eight
toimes yit, loike as not.”</p>

<p>“Shet up, ye dumb fool!” shouted the old whaleman.
“We’re consarned well rid o’ her.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve still four cats aboard,” Jim reminded
him teasingly. “And two of them are
black.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem glared at the boy and stumped off
without another word.</p>

<p>Slowly the <i>Narwhal</i> beat back to the northward.
Two days later she entered Rowe’s Welcome and
came to anchor in the sheltered bay within a short
distance of the shore. Close to the spot, near the
mouth of a river, were a score or more of Eskimo
skin tents, and upon the shingle at the river’s mouth
were drawn dozens of kayaks. Before the <i>Narwhal’s</i>
chains roaring from the hawse holes had roused the
echoes of the hills, the Eskimos were paddling towards
the schooner. At their first glance the boys
saw that here at last were the Eskimos they had
always pictured. Clad in garments of skin and fur
they came scrambling over the <i>Narwhal’s</i> rail, laughing
and grinning, copper-faced and slant-eyed, but
far cleaner than those at Hebron or Disko, and with
something about them which at once marked them
as true primitive people untouched by civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Their spears, harpoons, and arrows were tipped with
ivory or bone, their faces were tattooed and their
garments were highly decorated with beads and skin
embroidery.</p>

<p>Presently, from the waist of the ship, came roars
of laughter and good-natured shouts. The boys,
glancing up, saw a number of the crew leaning over
the bulwarks while others were hurrying to join the
group.</p>

<p>“What’n tarnation’s up now?” exclaimed Cap’n
Pem as with the boys by his side he hurried forward.</p>

<p>As they reached the crowd of men, Swanson
straightened up from the rail over which he was
leaning, took his pipe from his mouth and grinned
under his big yellow mustache. With a humorous
twinkle in his deep-set blue eyes he remarked, “Ay
tank das cat bane come back.”</p>

<p>As the old whaleman peered over the ship’s side,
his eyes seemed about to pop from his head, his jaw
dropped and he stared down at the kayaks below as
if he had seen a ghost. Perched on the rounded
skin deck of one of the canoes was the black cat!</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be everlastin’ly keelhauled!” ejaculated
the old man and, as a roar of laughter rose from
the men’s throats, he jammed his cap over his eyes
and stumped aft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>But even the superstitious old whaleman could find
nothing in the way of ill luck with which to blame
the cat during the next few days. The Eskimos had
quantities of walrus ivory, many fine skins and pelts
and a goodly amount of whalebone on hand, and
this was soon in the <i>Narwhal’s</i> hold while the natives
were richer in calico, knives, iron, beads and matches
than they had ever dreamed of being.</p>

<p>Old Pem fairly beamed, and he rubbed his calloused
hands gleefully as he saw the bales, packages,
and bundles being stowed. “Purty nice little nest
egg,” he chuckled. “Nigh two thousand dollars wuth
o’ stuff I reckon. Swan, if this keeps on if we don’t
go sailin’ inter New Bedford full up.”</p>

<p>The boys were far more interested in the Eskimos
and their village than in the skins and bone. They
spent most of their time ashore, and with Mr. Kemp or
Unavik as interpreters they learned much of the Eskimos’
life and ways. They watched them fish in the
river, made friends with the Eskimo boys, played with
the roly-poly children, and spent hours in the tents
watching the women as they chewed the hides to cure
them and deftly fashioned the skins and furs into
garments.</p>

<p>“Gee, they use bone needles!” exclaimed Jim the
first time he saw one of the women sewing a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of moccasins, “and thimbles made of raw hide and
threads of sinew. Say, I wonder how they’d like
real needles and thread.”</p>

<p>The next time they went ashore they carried a supply
of needles, thread, thimbles and other sewing material
and presented them to the women. Instantly the
crude bone and rawhide utensils were cast aside and
with beaming faces and ejaculations of delight, the
women chattered and laughed as they experimented
with the bright steel needles and shiny thimbles. As
Tom said, they were like children with new toys and
when in return—for even the least gift calls for a
return present with the Eskimos—the women loaded
the boys down with exquisitely worked moccasins,
shirts of eider skins, blouse-like coats of fox and seal
and robes of wolf and musk ox skins, the two lads
were as pleased and excited as the women had been.</p>

<p>“Say, we’ve got to learn to talk Eskimo,” declared
Tom. “It’ll be lots more fun if we can talk to
these people.”</p>

<p>So, with Mr. Kemp’s help, the two boys set diligently
to work to learn the Eskimos’ language and
progressed rapidly. At first they found it a most difficult
task to pronounce the odd, clucking gutturals,
but once they mastered the rudiments they got on
famously. Within a short time they were able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
ask questions and understand the replies, and they
had acquired quite a vocabulary of names and
words.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the crew of the ship had not been
idle. The schooner had been stripped of sails, topmasts
and yards were sent down, and preparations
made for the coming winter. Daily the whale boats
had been manned, and under their spritsails had gone
dancing off across the bay in search of whales.
Sometimes they were gone for several days and returned
empty handed, but often they would come
sailing back in a long line and towing the carcasses
of one or two huge bowheads. Then every one
worked like beavers, cutting in and boiling until
the oil and bone were safely under hatches.</p>

<p>At first the boys were crazy to go out on these
hunts, but after one or two experiences, they decided
there was far more of interest about the village and
the shores, and devoted their time to hunting and
paddling about the Welcome in a kayak which they
had secured for themselves.</p>

<p>Near the village there was little game, for the Eskimos’
dogs roamed about, picking up every stray
hare, ptarmigan, or other live thing, and so the boys
went farther and farther afield on their excursions.
The weather still held warm and pleasant, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the nights were cold and the little ponds and lakes
between the hills were coated with ice. A few miles
from the village the boys found game in abundance.
One spot in particular was a favorite hunting ground—a
little island in the broad estuary of the Welcome
where the Wager River emptied into the bay.
Here there were always ducks in the coves, hares
nibbled the stunted shrubs among the rocks, ptarmigan
gathered in flocks on the southern sides of the
hills, and twice the boys had secured seals which
they had surprised basking on the shore. One of
these was a magnificent silver seal; the other a half-grown
hooded seal. The two handsome hides had
been cured and made into garments by the boys’
Eskimo women friends.</p>

<p>One day as the two boys were paddling their kayak
around the island keeping a sharp lookout for game,
Jim muttered a low exclamation and pointed towards
the open water of the estuary. Tom peered intently
as he ceased paddling, but for a moment could see
nothing. Then, a few hundred yards away, something
broke the surface of the water and a tiny
column of spray rose in the air.</p>

<p>“Golly, it’s a whale!” cried Tom in subdued tones.
“Say, let’s go for him!”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Jim, “it’s a little fellow—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
white whale, I guess. Say, won’t it be fine if
we can get him all by ourselves?”</p>

<p>Swinging the kayak, Tom drove his paddle into
the water while Jim, laying aside his rifle, got out
the harpoon and placed the lance ready for use.</p>

<p>Apparently totally unaware that enemies were
near, the creature remained almost stationary, now
and then rolling lazily at the surface, sometimes
raising its tail and bringing it down with a resounding
splash as if in play, and constantly blowing.
Rapidly the kayak approached. Jim grasped the harpoon
firmly, saw that the line was clear and, shaking
with excitement, he prepared to strike. Then,
as the frail craft slipped within a dozen feet of the
cetacean and Jim raised his arm, he realized that
it was no white whale, but a strange, dull-colored,
bluish creature with the skin covered with irregular
blackish spots. But, whatever it was, the animal was
within striking range and, summoning all his
strength, Jim hurled the iron into the spotted animal’s
back just as it rose above the surface to blow.</p>

<p>The next instant a volcano seemed to have burst
into eruption beneath the waves. The water boiled
and frothed; a broad tail flashed and struck and
swung to right and left, the kayak danced and careened
and bobbed upon the heaving surface. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as Jim, frightened half out of his wits by the actions
of the strange beast, was about to cut the line, the
creature hurled itself forward and raced off like a
cyclone. With a terrific jerk the kayak swung about,
tipped until it almost capsized, and went tearing after
the stricken animal. This was something the boys
had not counted on. They had watched the Eskimos
when they struck white whales and had intended to
follow the native method of throwing overboard the
float of skin. They had no intention of being towed
in a cranky kayak by a maddened whale. But the
line had kinked and had fouled. Jim, despite his
frantic efforts, could not free it while it was under
the terrific strain, and so it was a case of either being
towed and trusting to luck to escape being capsized
and drowned, or cutting the line.</p>

<p>“Don’t cut it!” screamed Tom as he saw Jim raise
his heavy hunting knife. “Wait till we see we’re
in danger!”</p>

<p>Breathing hard, thrilled with the excitement and
yet filled with terror, Jim waited, knife in hand, while
the whale sped this way and that, sounded and
milled; but to the boys’ surprise, never breached.
But as the bouyant kayak continued right side up and
nothing happened, the boys gained confidence and
each time the creature slackened its pace Jim hauled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in line until the kayak was almost within striking distance
of the whale. Then, so suddenly that Tom
could not check the kayak’s motion, the creature halted
in its rush and the next instant dashed straight towards
the canoe.</p>

<p>Jim gave a terrified scream of warning. Tom dug
his paddle into the water and as the kayak responded
to the effort and swung slightly, the spotted creature
dashed by within a foot of the craft.</p>

<p>Jim, who had been expecting to kill the animal
an instant before, still held the lance in his hand.
As the cetacean rushed past him, he lunged forward
and scarcely knowing what he did, plunged the
weapon into the creature’s side. At the blow, the
animal threw itself from the water, the lance was
wrenched from Jim’s grip and the boys’ eyes grew
wide in wonder. In the brief instant that the whale
was out of water they had seen that a long, gleaming
shaft projected from its head!</p>

<p>But before they could utter a cry, before they realized
what had happened, the big spotted body crashed
back into the water, bloody froth spouted from its
blow hole and with a convulsive flip of its tail
it rolled over on its side against the kayak, stone
dead.</p>

<p>“Whew!” cried Jim, as he wiped the perspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
from his face and blinked his eyes. “We did catch
a tartar that time!”</p>

<p>“You bet we did!” agreed Tom heartily. “But
we got him just the same. Gosh, but that <em>was</em> a
dandy stroke of yours—getting him on the wing that
way. And did you see his head—he’s been struck
before and the lance or iron’s sticking in his nose.
I wonder what the dickens he is anyway.”</p>

<p>“Gee Christopher!” cried Jim who had been examining
their catch. “That’s not a lance in his nose—it
belongs there—it’s a sort of horn. Look, it’s
like ivory and twisted.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Tom. “I know what ’tis—we’ve
killed the schooner’s namesake. It’s a
narwhal!”</p>

<p>“Golly, you’re right!” cried Jim. “Won’t Cap’n
Pem and the others be surprised! But say—I’d
never have dared touch him if I’d known. Remember
how Mr. Kemp told us about these fellows
driving their tusks right through a whaleboat and
sinking it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say I do,” replied Tom. “I know what
they’ll say—‘fools rush in,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, fools or not, we won,” declared Jim,
“and this old fellow’s horn’ll make <em>some</em> trophy up
in our room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Elated at their unexpected capture, the boys forgot
all about their hunt and, fastening a line about the
narwhal’s tail, they started to tow him to the schooner.
It was slow, backbreaking work, but when at last
they reached their vessel and showed their catch to
those on board, they felt amply rewarded for their
labors.</p>

<p>“By the love av hivvin!” cried Mike, who was the
first to see the dead creature. “Shure and ’tis a
unicorn yez do be afther killin’!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be swizzled!” exclaimed Cap’n Pem. “Ye
everlastin’ young scallawags, what ye mean by a-goin’
in on one o’ them critters? Ye’re lucky he didn’t
sink ye. Jes like ye though—fools allers——”</p>

<p>“I know it!” laughed Tom. “I told Jimmy you’d
say that. But we got him and didn’t get hurt, even
if the cat did come back!”</p>

<p>“Jes dumb luck,” declared the old whaleman.
Then, as Captain Edwards appeared, he shouted,
“Look a-here, didn’t I tell ye these here boys wuz
born to be whalers? Jes take a squint ’longside
an’ see what the young scallawags been a-doin’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be——” ejaculated the skipper. “Reckon
you’re proud of yourselves. Whoppin’ big fellow,
too. Give you a tussle, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not so much,” replied Tom nonchalantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
“But he had us scared. The line fouled and he
towed us every which way and then went for us.
And say, you ought to have seen Jim get him!
Lanced him as he went scooting by the kayak full
speed.”</p>

<p>“Darned lucky he did!” declared Mr. Kemp who
had joined the group. “If he hadn’t the blamed
critter’d have turned and drove his horn through
that kayak and through you too, like as not.”</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t know,” laughed Jim, “or we
wouldn’t have tackled him. But I’m not sorry now.
Just the same, we’ll know better next time. I’m
not a bit anxious to catch another narwhal.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as we really did, this time,” said
Tom. “Seems to me the narwhal caught us and we
didn’t have much to say about it.”</p>

<p>“H’lo!” exclaimed Unavik strolling up. “Ugh!
me say bimeby you feller be big hunter. Gimme
t’bac!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">FROZEN IN</span></h2>

<p>On the morning after their capture of the narwhal,
the boys came on deck to find
the weather completely changed. Above
stretched a dull gray sky, great flakes of snow were
drifting down, the land was already hidden under a
thin coat of white and, at the first touch of the biting
wind, the two dodged back to their cabin to reappear
clad from head to foot in their Eskimo garments.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp laughed heartily as he saw them. “All
ready for the winter, eh?” he cried. “What you
goin’ to wear when it’s really cold?”</p>

<p>“You can’t say anything,” retorted Tom, “you’ve
got on a sweater and a reefer and oilskins yourself.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a bit sharp, I’ll admit,” replied the second
officer. “Looks like summer’s about over. Them
Eskimos know it. If this keeps up, they’ll be a-setting
up their igloos to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why, the water’s freezing!” exclaimed Jim who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had peered over the schooner’s side. “Hurrah,
we’ll be able to walk ashore now!”</p>

<p>“Walk ashore!” exclaimed Mr. Kemp. “Why,
bless you, if the weather keeps on as it oughta, you
could run a train acrost the bay inside a week.”</p>

<p>Already thin ice had formed on the surface of
the water and, although each swell coming into the
Welcome broke the newly formed ice with a curious
crackling sound, fresh ice formed almost as
rapidly as it was destroyed, and the upended little
cakes were congealing in a jagged, hummocky surface
that bade fair to imprison the waves very soon
and lock them fast for many months.</p>

<p>The rigging was white with snow and a couple of
inches of the soft feathery blanket lay on the decks.
The crew, clad in oilskins and sweaters, with
caps pulled over ears and mittens on hands, were
busy hammering and pounding as they put the finishing
touches to the long, shedlike structure that they
had erected extending from the poop to the foremast.
Ashore, the Eskimos were dragging their kayaks far
from the water’s edge and were placing them upside
down on racks of whale’s ribs. The women were
piling stones upon the edges of their skin dwellings
and the boys were yelling shrilly and cracking their
long whips as they gathered the dogs together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Hourly the cold increased. The snowflakes became
finer and fell faster and faster; the wind came
in fitful gusts and whirled the snow into drifts.
When the pale light faded soon after noon and the
boys knew that the sun had set, land, sea, and ship
were covered deep with snow.</p>

<p>Day after day the storm continued. The Eskimos’
tents were buried halfway to their peaked tops
in the drifts; the rough plank house upon the schooner
was like a huge snowbank, and even the tough and
hardened old whalemen had donned suits of skins and
furs. Then one day came a muffled hail through
the blinding snow, and looking over the <i>Narwhal’s</i>
side, the surprised boys saw two of the Eskimos
standing upon the snow-covered ice beneath them.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, they can walk on it!” cried Tom and,
followed by Jim, he clambered over the schooner’s
rails and leaped on to the ice.</p>

<p>“Gee, we’re frozen in!” yelled Jim. “It’s really
winter. Come on, let’s go and see what the Eskimos
are doing.”</p>

<p>“Look out, ye young scallawags,” roared Cap’n
Pem. “Ye’ll git lost.”</p>

<p>“No danger,” called back Tom. “We’ll get one
of the Eskimos to go with us.”</p>

<p>Turning, he spoke to the fur-clad men in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
own tongue and accompanied by one of them, the
two boys pushed their way through the snow towards
shore.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re building igloos!” exclaimed Jim as
they came in sight of the Eskimos. “And on the ice
too.”</p>

<p>Interestedly the two boys watched the natives as
they labored at their winter homes. With long-bladed
snow knives carved from walrus tusks the
men cut the blocks of frozen snow and piled them
in a circle, tier on tier, each a little smaller than the
one preceding. Rapidly the low-domed huts grew
and took on form and soon the first one was completed.
With yells of delight Tom and Jim crawled
into the tunnel-like entrance and found themselves
within the igloo.</p>

<p>“Say, isn’t this jolly!” cried Tom. “Come on,
Jim, let’s make one for ourselves. It’ll be great
sport having an igloo with the Eskimos.”</p>

<p>Enthusiastically the two set to work, borrowing
snow knives from their Eskimo friends, but they
soon found that building an igloo was an art and
they joined heartily in the Eskimos’ merriment when
the wall tumbled in and all their work came to
nothing. They were not discouraged, and presently
one of the Eskimo boys came to their aid. With his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
help the boys soon got the knack of the work and
before it was time to return to the schooner for
dinner their igloo was completed.</p>

<p>The night was almost as bright as day with the
Northern Lights reflected from the vast stretch of spotless
white. By midnight the storm was over; stars
twinkled brilliantly in the deep purple sky, the little
group of igloos rose above the flat, white plain of ice-like,
snow-covered bee hives. The wind was so bitingly,
intensely cold that the boys were glad indeed to
seek shelter in the deck house with its cheery red-hot
stove.</p>

<p>Then followed days filled with constant novelty,
interest, and delight for the two boys. They went
with the Eskimos on hunts for seal, and learned to
find the blow holes in the ice through which the creatures
came up to breathe. With their snow knives
they cut great rectangular slabs of frozen snow and
placed them upright near the holes as windbreaks,
and with rifles grasped in their fur-gloved hands, and
warm as toast in their eider skin undergarments and
sealskin costumes, they lay upon the surface of the
frozen bay and watched the holes while the wind
swept downward from the North Pole, and the thermometer
dropped to many degrees below zero. Often
their vigil would gain them nothing. But many times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a big hooded seal, a sheeny silversides, or a magnificent
harp seal would fall a victim to their rifles.
Much of their time too they spent in their igloo which
they had fitted up exactly like those of their Eskimo
neighbors, with skins and furs covering the bench
of ice around the sides, a soapstone lamp filled with
whale oil, with a moss wick to give light and heat,
and with their weapons and trophies scattered about.
From one of the natives they had purchased a team
of dogs. Unavik had made them a sledge, and after
many trials, unending merriment, countless upsets,
and getting hopelessly tangled, the two boys had
learned to drive their huskies fairly well. There was
nothing they loved better than to go sledding over the
frozen snow, yelling at their dogs, cracking their
long whips, and now and then leaping on to the vehicle
and traveling like the wind through the frosty stinging
air lit by the pale winter sun or the gorgeous
Aurora.</p>

<p>Much time also they spent in the Eskimos’ igloos
and, their first squeamishness at the dirt and filth of
the people being overcome, they found them very
pleasant and good company. Sometimes, as a blizzard
howled outside, and the dogs cowered whimpering
at the mouth of the entrance tunnel, the Eskimos
would while away the hours telling stories. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
these were very quaint, others were humorous and
still others were almost poems with their vivid descriptive
phrases and beautiful sentiments.</p>

<p>But the boys’ favorites were the folklore tales
about the birds and animals they knew so well.
Usually some chance remark or question of the boys
would start the story and all would listen attentively
while the gray-haired, wrinkled, old <i>ananating</i>
(grandmother) would tell in story form why certain
things were so. Once, for example, Jim was examining
a reindeer skin and called Tom’s attention to
the white rump and the stubby little tail. Amaluk,
who was making a snow knife, glanced up. “Perhaps,”
he said in the dialect the boys now understood
perfectly, “Nepaluka will tell you how the reindeer
lost their tails.”</p>

<p>“Do,” begged Tom, “tell us the story, <i>Ananating</i>.”</p>

<p>The old woman was busily mending a skin shirt,
her near-sighted eyes close to her work, her clawlike
fingers moving deftly as she plied the bone needle—for
she alone of all the women still preferred the
Eskimo needles to those of the white men.</p>

<p>“Ai ai!” she exclaimed. “The clothes are mended
and my eyes are weary and perchance it may be well
to tell of Amook and the reindeer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Laying aside the carefully mended shirt she leaned
back among the thick bearskins and began.</p>

<p>“Many ages ago,” she said in her droning voice,
“before the Eskimos first came to the land, all the
reindeer were brown from head to foot and all wore
bushy tails like the foxes. In those times lived a
great <i>anticoot</i> (magician) named Amook and to him
belonged all the animals and birds. And all the
creatures roamed at will except the reindeer, for these
Amook kept hidden in a great hole in the earth.</p>

<p>“Every day Amook would come from the hole and,
after pulling a big stone over the entrance to his
home, he would travel far and wide caring for his
creatures. In those days the birds and animals were
all one color, and when winter came and snow fell
upon the land their brown bodies were plain to be
seen and the creatures saw one another afar, so it
was easy indeed for the owls and hawks to see the
ptarmigan and kill them, and for the foxes and
wolves to see the hares and devour them. At last so
many were killed that Amook grew afraid that his live
things would all be destroyed, and he would be left
without food to eat or furs to make his clothes. So,
being a magician, he made many spells, until at last,
by touching the fur of an animal or the feathers of a
bird, he could change the brown to white. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
when the winter came, Amook would go forth and
call the birds and the beasts together, and as they came
at his call, he would stroke them with his hands, and
they would go forth white and spotless. But soon
Amook was again troubled, for when spring came
and the snow melted and the rocks and moss were
bare, the white creatures were like spots of snow upon
the brown land and fell easy prey to their enemies.
Then from far and near the birds and beasts flocked
to their master and begged him to make them brown
once more. So Amook made another spell in his
hole under the earth, and when he came forth and
touched the birds and the beasts, behold! they were
changed from white to brown as before.</p>

<p>“So, as each winter came, Amook would change the
brown creatures to white and when the winter had
passed and the geese came to the northland, he would
again change the white to brown.</p>

<p>“But some of the creatures were wary and would
not come to their master’s bidding and Amook had
hard work to capture them. It was thus with the
great bear for he loved his white coat that helped him
to hide on the bergs and floes, and try as Amook
might, he never caught him to change his coat to
brown, and so the bear to this day is always white
and changes not to brown in the spring. So too, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
white owl in his white coat could perch motionless on
a rock and all creatures would take him for a harmless
bit of ice and would approach so near that he
could pounce upon them easily. Time and again
Amook crept close to catch the owl, but never did he
grasp him, although the tips of his fingers touched
the owl’s feathers as he flew off and to this day you
may see the round brown finger marks left by Amook
on the feathers of the owl. The weasel too, timid
and suspicious, but too cowardly to disobey his
master, crept sneaking from the rocks and crouched
snarling to the earth as Amook passed his hand over
his back, and the tip of his tail, which was hidden in
the rocks, is always black and his belly that was
pressed upon the earth remains ever white. Many
other things—the geese and ducks, the snipes and
hawks—flew southward before Amook came forth to
change their colors and so, throughout the year, their
coats remain the same. But the hare and the fox<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and the ptarmigan came always at Amook’s call and
grew cunning and hid safely from their enemies.</p>

<p>“Through all this time the reindeer, deep in their
hole, remained brown, for under the earth there was
neither winter nor summer. One day as Amook came
back to his hole the raven, flying by, saw him step out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of sight. Always curious, the raven wondered what
Amook had hidden in the earth and pondering on the
matter he flew to his friend the fox. ‘Ai, ai!’ he exclaimed.
‘Tell me, O brother, what your master
keeps in his home beneath the earth. You whom
he fondles and strokes to white or brown must
know.’</p>

<p>“But the fox knew not and said so to the raven.
This made the black bird more curious yet and he
asked, ‘Why have you never found out? Have you
never wondered, O brother, where this Amook gets his
power to turn brown to white and white to brown?
Think you how fine it would be to know the secret of
his power. With it in thy paws thou couldst change
color at will and like the owl pose as a bit of ice in
summer or like a bare rock in winter. Truly, O little
friend, you would find hunting easy.’</p>

<p>“Now the fox was a born thief and most cunning,
and the words of the raven set him thinking. At last
he spoke. ‘With thy help, black brother, I may find
out. We will hide close to the hole of Amook and
when he comes forth thou wilt fly high in the air and
croak loudly, and when Amook looks up I will place
a bit of rock beneath the cover of the hole so it will
not close tightly. Then, when Amook has passed,
we will enter his dwelling and steal the charm.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“So it came about that when Amook again went
forth, the cunning fox lurked near, and, in the air
above, the raven croaked hoarsely. Just as the two
had planned, Amook looked up at the sound and the
fox slyly slipped a bit of stone under the edge of the
door to Amook’s house, and when he shoved the door
in place a small opening was left which he did not
see.</p>

<p>“Then, when Amook had gone, the raven flew
down, and with his friend the fox entered Amook’s
home. After a long time they came to a great valley
and there, feeding on rich green moss, was a great
herd of reindeer all brown and with bushy tails.
The fox and the raven were filled with wonder at
this sight of the strange creatures with the branching
horns, and the deer, who had never seen another living
thing save Amook, were also filled with wonder,
and with fear as well, at sight of the fox and his
friend.</p>

<p>“But the raven with his flattery and the fox with his
cunning soon overcame the reindeer’s fears and talked
with them. The deer knew nothing of Amook’s spell,
for they had never been changed to white; and the
fox and raven, finding the deer dull and stupid, began
to tell them of the wonders of the outside world. At
last the simple deer were interested, and longed to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
forth and gladly followed the raven and the fox to the
opening in the rocks.</p>

<p>“One after the other they squeezed through and
just as the last one had come forth Amook came home.
When he saw that the deer had escaped, he rushed
forward and with outstretched hands tried to push
the deer back into the hole. But the deer, pleased
at the outside world, struck at him with their feet
and where Amook’s hands had touched their foreheads
broad white marks appeared, for Amook had
been forth to turn all creatures white for the coming
winter and the charm was still upon his hands.</p>

<p>“Then Amook, running about, seized the deer by
their tails and strove to pull them into the hole.
The deer struggled and tugged and all at once their
tails broke off in Amook’s hands and the magician,
tumbling head over heels, rolled into the opening
beneath the stone.</p>

<p>“Then the deer pushed the bit of rock from beneath
the stone door which fell into place and shut Amook
up forever. But as the deer’s leader closed the
rock door, one of the prongs of his antlers was caught
between the stones and in drawing it free it was bent
and twisted in front of the deer’s face.</p>

<p>“And so, to this day, every reindeer has a twisted
part to his horns before his face and a stubby tail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and where Amook grasped their tails and touched
their rumps and pushed on their foreheads, the white
patches still remain.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Tom, quite forgetting the old woman
did not understand English, and then thanking her in
her own tongue and telling her what a fine story it
was, the boys started to leave.</p>

<p>At that instant a tousled black head appeared in
the entrance tunnel, a broad face grinned up, and
Unavik crawled into the igloo.</p>

<p>“H’lo!” he exclaimed in his invariable greeting.
“Me feller see plenty reindeer. Sure Mike, much
plenty! Mebbe you like for shootum?”</p>

<p>“Would we!” yelled the two boys in unison.
“Come on, Unavik. You bet we’d like to shootum.”</p>

<p>Outside the igloo, Unavik’s sledge stood waiting.
Stopping only to get their guns the two boys piled on
to the sledge, Unavik cracked his whip, shouted to the
shaggy dogs and they were off. Over the snow-clad
land, through the still, intensely cold air they
sped, swinging along frozen water courses, toiling
up steep hills, dashing with dizzying speed down the
slopes for mile after mile. Then, with a low command,
Unavik halted his team, and signaling to the
boys for caution, he unhitched his dogs and led the
way up a low knoll. Crouching on the snow beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the Eskimo, Tom and Jim peered over the ridge.
Below was a small swale or valley and there, quietly
feeding on the gray moss scraped free from snow
with their broad hoofs, was a herd of fully fifty big
reindeer.</p>

<p>But they were far out of range; there was no
cover by which the boys could stalk them, and it
seemed as if their trip would be fruitless. As the
boys, disappointed, drew back, Unavik was rapidly
freeing his dogs from their rawhide harness, and
with a low word of command he led them to the hill
top and turned them loose.</p>

<p>With low growls the animals leaped forward and
tore down the slope towards the deer, yelping and
barking, teeth bared and hair bristling. Instantly,
at sight of the dogs, the reindeer gathered together
in a close packed bunch, tails in center and threatening
antlers in a defensive ring. For a moment the
dogs hesitated, and circled about, uttering short savage
snarls, but knowing well the deadly peril that
lurked in those sharp, lowered prongs and knife-edged
hoofs. Then one big husky, more courageous
than his fellows, sprang forward with a yelp, and the
next second was tossed howling and bleeding for a
dozen feet in the air.</p>

<p>Unavik touched the boys’ arms and beckoned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
them to follow. Down the hill he led them, across
the end of the little valley and up a frozen mound of
drifted snow. Intent on the dogs, the deer gave no
heed to the fur clad figures sneaking across the snow,
if indeed they saw them, and in a few moments the
three were within a few hundred feet of the herd.
Taking careful aim at the two largest deer, the boys
fired. As the reports rang out across the frozen
land, the reindeer threw up their heads and, forgetting
the dogs in their new terror, raced down the
valley leaving two of their number dead upon the
trampled snow. Now was the dogs’ chance, and
yelping, snapping, barking, they raced after the deer,
nipping at their heels, biting savagely at their flanks
like the half-wolves they were. Now and then a
deer would turn and strike viciously with his big
hoofs at his tormentors and presently the herd again
formed in a circle with lowered heads and menacing
hoofs. Already they had forgotten the gun shots in
the face of this greater peril of the wolfish dogs, and
the boys once more raised their rifles to shoot.</p>

<p>“We don’t need more than one more,” whispered
Jim. “You kill him, Tom. Your gun’s better at
that range.”</p>

<p>Once more, as the report roared out, a deer fell and
the herd, now thoroughly terrified, fled at top speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
towards the east with the savage dogs at their heels.
The dogs followed only a short distance. There in
the valley were the fallen deer and the scent of blood
and, snarling and baying, they came tearing back
and dashed ravenously upon the body of the last deer
killed. Before they could tear the skin or bury their
sharp white teeth in the carcass, Unavik was among
them, lashing out with his cruel whip, shouting shrill
orders and striking cutting blows right and left.
Growling sullenly, the dogs drew back, crouching,
whimpering, cringing with tails between legs and ears
laid back. Paying no heed to the threatening bared
teeth and updrawn lips, the Eskimo stepped among
them, rapidly secured the thongs about their necks
together and then, with a word to the boys, drove
his huskies over the knoll before him.</p>

<p>In a few moments he was back with the sledge, and
with the boys’ help the deer’s body was lifted upon
it and lashed securely in place. But one deer was
all the sled could carry, and Unavik told the boys
they would have to carry the first deer to the village
and return with the sledge and more dogs for the
others.</p>

<p>“But won’t something eat them while we’re gone?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Sure Mike, mebbe,” replied the Eskimo who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
proud of his fragmentary English, never spoke to
the boys in his own tongue if he could avoid it. “Me
say plenty wolf, plenty bear, mebbe eatum.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Jim as a sudden idea came to
him. “Say, Tom, we’ll stay here and watch while
Unavik goes to the village. Then if wolves or bears
come we can shoot them.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bully scheme,” agreed Tom. “Go ahead,
Unavik, we’ll wait here.”</p>

<p>For a moment the Eskimo hesitated. He knew the
boys had no idea as to where they were and he was responsible
for their safety. But the sky was clear,
there was no danger of a blizzard and as long as they
remained within sight of the dead deer there seemed
no danger.</p>

<p>“A’right,” he agreed presently. “No try walk.
You feller make get los’ die plenty quick, me say;
sure Mike!”</p>

<p>“We’ll stay right here,” declared Tom. “No fear
of our wandering off.”</p>

<p>Satisfied that the boys were all right, Unavik
shouted to his dogs, cracked his whip, shoved on the
handles of his sled to start it, and the next minute was
speeding away towards the village.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">UNAVIK TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p>Returning to the spot from which they had
first shot the deer, the two boys hollowed
a little cavity in the frozen snow within
easy range of the dead reindeer and cuddled down
cozily to await Unavik’s return or the appearance of
any wild beast that might be attracted by the scent
of blood. At first the land, stretching in undulating
white hills to the horizon, seemed deserted, absolutely
devoid of life, a desolate, barren waste. But presently
the boys discovered that all about were living creatures.</p>

<p>A subdued twitter drew their attention to a sheltered
spot under a projecting ledge. Peering intently
at it, the boys saw a little flock of snow buntings and
longspurs hopping about. On a low snow ridge a few
rods away, a bit of the white surface moved, and a
big Arctic hare rose from its hiding place and looked
suspiciously about before leaping off.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a frightened cry from behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
them. As the boys wheeled, a great broad-winged
white gyrfalcon swooped like a meteor, struck deep
into the snow and, with a cloud of dazzling, glistening
crystals like diamond dust swirling from his powerful
wings, rose slowly with a ptarmigan grasped in
his talons.</p>

<p>Presently from far up in the blue sky came a
hoarse raucous croak. Glancing up the boys saw two
tiny black specks that rapidly increased in size as two
great ravens came flapping downwards. Perching
upon the antlers of the dead deer they eyed the carcass
suspiciously and, cocking their heads on one
side, they peered in the boys’ direction as though
they knew human beings were there—as no doubt
they did.</p>

<p>“Say, if those birds start in they’ll ruin the deer,”
whispered Tom.</p>

<p>“No, they won’t,” replied Jim. “The bodies must
be frozen stiff by now. Don’t you remember Unavik
told us ravens wait for some animal to tear the hide
and meat and scatter bits of it about before they can
eat?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Tom. “Hello, look there!”</p>

<p>Close to the deer a shadow seemed to slip across
the snow. The boys glanced up, expecting to see
some big hawk or a snowy owl sailing above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
valley. But the sky was unbroken by any bird.
Curiously Tom and Jim stared through the narrow
slits of their snow spectacles at the slowly moving,
indistinct shadow. Closer and closer the thing drew
to the dead deer. It seemed to have no definite outline,
to be merely a faint, bluish, shapeless haze
against the snow—a ghostlike thing so unreal that
the boys began to think the dazzling snow had affected
their eyes. Then, with a sudden motion, the shadow
sprang across the snow and a little ball of white appeared
upon the dark surface of the deer’s body as if
by magic.</p>

<p>“It’s a fox!” whispered Jim. “A white fox. I’m
going to shoot him.”</p>

<p>“Aim for his head,” cautioned Tom in a whisper,
“or you’ll spoil the skin.”</p>

<p>Resting his rifle on the frozen ridge before him,
Jim glanced through the sights. But the fox’s head
was turned and he hesitated, waiting until he had a
fair shot, for he knew that his soft-nosed bullet,
striking the beautiful snowy body, would tear it to
bits and ruin the pelt. Second after second passed
and still the fox kept his head turned away from the
boys as he gnawed ravenously at the edges of the
bullet wound in the deer’s side, while the two ravens
croaked at him in protest and cautiously hopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
nearer and nearer, in the hopes of stealing a stray
morsel from under the fluffy white creature’s nose.</p>

<p>Tom chuckled softly. “There’s the raven asking
brother fox where Amook keeps his magic,” he whispered.
“I can almost imagine I can understand the
black rascal’s words.”</p>

<p>But Jim did not reply. The fox had suddenly
stiffened. His head was raised. His ears were
pricked forward as if listening. The ravens flapped
back to their perch on the antlers. Jim’s finger
pressed against the trigger. If the fox raised his
head an inch higher, he would send the bullet true
between the ears. And then, just as the sights were
lined fair upon the round white head, the fox leaped
away. There was a sound of crunching snow from
the hillside and Jim, glancing around, uttered a
suppressed, startled exclamation. Within fifty feet
of where the boys crouched, a huge white bear was
moving towards the dead deer!</p>

<p>“Gosh!” whispered Tom. “What luck!”</p>

<p>“Let’s both shoot together,” whispered Jim, his
voice trembling with excitement. “We can’t miss.
Aim back of the fore shoulder and when I count
three, fire.”</p>

<p>Instantly both rifles were swung towards the big,
yellowish white creature, and as for a moment he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
halted and his long neck moved back and forth, and
his black nose sniffed the air, Jim counted; “One,
two, three!” and the two guns roared out as one.</p>

<p>With startled hoarse croaks the raven took wing.
The huge shaggy bear reared on its hind legs, pawed
frantically at the air, growled, snapped his long white
teeth savagely, and then lurched forward and slid
a dozen feet down the hillside.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! we got him!” yelled Jim and leaping
up the boys raced towards the fallen bear without
stopping to reload their rifles.</p>

<p>Like a miniature mountain of shaggy white fur he
lay there, a broad red splotch upon his side. The
two elated boys, whooping and yelling, hurried forward.
They were within a dozen feet of the enormous
creature when to their horror and amazement
the bear scrambled to his feet and with open jaws
and savage growls sprang at them.</p>

<p>Uttering one wild yell of terror, the boys turned
and fled up the hill for their lives. Behind them they
could hear the low, menacing, awful growls and the
sound of crunching snow. As they gained the summit
of the ridge they turned, threw up their rifles,
took quick aim and pulled the triggers.</p>

<p>But the hammers clicked harmlessly upon the empty
shells. There was no time even to throw fresh cartridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
into the chambers of their rifles. Less than
twenty feet separated them from the infuriated,
wounded monster. Again, yelling, they took to their
heels. Then, to Tom’s brain, came a sudden remembrance,
the story of Ukla and the fog which Unavik
had told them, and in panting, gasping words he
shouted to Jim:</p>

<p>“Don’t run down hill! Run along the side and
then up again!”</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing why he did so, Jim obeyed, and
winded, almost ready to drop, the boys again gained
the summit of the ridge. Once more they glanced
back. Tom’s ruse had worked. The bear, heavy and
cumbersome, had been unable to check his own momentum
as he topped the ridge and had half slid,
half rolled for fifty yards down the slippery slope.
But he had now turned and was once more lumbering
towards them. With shaking, trembling hands they
reloaded their rifles, took aim at the bear’s breast
and fired.</p>

<p>Their shots went wild. Bits of fur flew from the
bear’s back. He jerked his head to one side as a
bullet nicked his cheek and then, with redoubled roars
of rage and increased speed, he fairly hurled his
great body up the slope.</p>

<p>“Gee, I wish we were magicians!” gasped Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
“Come on—run down the hill a way and then up
again. It’s our only chance!”</p>

<p>Once more the two exhausted boys raced down the
hillside and then, quickly turning, ran to the top.
But this time the bear did not follow. He was no
fool and had learned a lesson. Galloping along the
ridge top he was almost upon the boys before they
knew it. As they glanced back and saw his drooling
red mouth and great yellow fangs within arm’s reach
they screamed in terror, dropped their rifles, and
thinking only of escape, tore straight down the
hill.</p>

<p>A roar behind them caused them to look back.
The bear was standing upon the hill, reared upon his
haunches and striking terrific sweeping blows at
the rifles. Maddened with pain, all his savagery
aroused, the creature was venting his anger on the
guns and the boys, almost exhausted, drenched with
perspiration, encumbered by their heavy fur garments,
won a breathing space by the reckless abandonment
of their weapons.</p>

<p>“We mus—must hu—hurry!” panted Jim. “May—maybe
if we—if we can keep up a wh—while
longer he’ll get ex—exhausted from loss of blood.
C—come on, Tom. Gosh, I w—wish Unavik would
come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Before them rose the steeper hill bordering the
valley to the west and up this the boys hurried as fast
as their wearied limbs would permit.</p>

<p>“Golly, wh—why isn’t there a ri—river he can
drink up?” panted Tom whose sense of humor could
not be downed even in the face of such danger. “Say,
wouldn’t <em>he</em> ma—make a fog if he burst!”</p>

<p>Barely had they gained the hill top when the
bear, his fury spent upon the rifles, was once more
sliding and slipping down the opposite hill and the
boys knew that it was only a question of minutes
before he would be upon them. Near by, a ledge
of rock jutted above the snow with its steep sides
sheathed in ice. The boys, too utterly exhausted to
run, saw in this their only hope.</p>

<p>“If we can get up there, perhaps he can’t reach
us,” suggested Tom. “Come on, Jim. It’s our
last chance.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t get up,” objected Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, we can,” declared Tom as they hurried
towards the rock. “I can climb up on your shoulders
and then reach down and pull you up.”</p>

<p>With their last strength, the boys gained the rock.
Tom clambered on Jim’s shoulders, drew himself on to
the flat summit and with a desperate effort reached
down and drew his companion up beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>And not an instant too soon. Before Jim’s feet
were over the edge the bear had gained the base of
the rock. He reared up, made a terrific swipe with
his fore paws at Jim’s dangling feet, and the boy
escaped death by an inch. Even as it was, one of the
beast’s swordlike claws ripped through Jim’s moccasin
and he howled with terror.</p>

<p>They were not yet safe. The bear, standing on
his hind legs, could actually reach the edge of the
rock’s summit and again and again he strove to
draw himself up; growling horribly, cutting great
grooves in the ice on the sides of the rock as he dug
his hind claws into it. The boys huddled close and
yelled each time one of the great, shaggy feet, with
its three-inch claws, appeared over the edge of their
refuge. Presently something of courage and confidence
returned to them. Unless the bear found a
grip, a crevice or a roughness on the rock for his
hind feet, he could not reach them. Wounded as he
was, his strength was unequal to the task of lifting
his enormous weight by his front feet alone. Still,
those fearful claws brought mortal terror to the boys
each time they appeared. Then an idea came to
Jim. Whipping out his heavy knife, he reached forward
and each time a paw appeared he rapped it
and slashed at it with the heavy steel blade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Roaring until the air trembled, the bear drew back
his feet and hurled himself bodily at the rock. At
his second onslaught the boys’ faces grew white, their
hearts seemed to stop beating. The rock moved!
There was not a question of it. Instead of a solid,
upjutting ledge as they had thought, it was merely a
big upstanding bowlder, a loose stone frozen to the
hilltop. At any moment it might crash over and
throw them, injured and helpless, into the grip of the
bear!</p>

<p>Sick with deadly fear, speechless, scarcely breathing,
the boys cowered on their narrow refuge, while
with each blow of the bear, the stone swayed and
rocked. Each time the boys expected to feel it toppling
to crash down into the snow.</p>

<p>Never in all their lives had such utter terror filled
their hearts. They were absolutely at the bear’s
mercy. The hope that his wounds might tell and that
his strength would give out were groundless. He
seemed as fresh, as strong and more maddened than
ever. The boys felt that only their mangled bleeding
bodies would remain to tell of their fate when Unavik
arrived. It was awful to be killed this way—ripped
and slashed and torn by the infuriated bear. Bitterly
the boys regretted having remained behind to
guard the bodies of the slain deer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I guess it’s all up with us,” stammered Tom,
trying to choke back the lump in his throat.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I only hope we—we get stunned when we
fall,” replied Jim, his voice breaking. “The—then
we won’t suffer so much.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when the bear again threw
himself at the rock. With a crackling of ice the
bowlder gave and swayed perilously. The boys
clutched wildly at the ice-filled crevices. They knew
that one more such effort on the part of the bear
would send the rock crashing over.</p>

<p>And then a new light came into their eyes, their
hearts beat faster. From beyond the next ridge had
come the sound of yelping dogs, the shrill shout of an
Eskimo.</p>

<p>The bear, despite his rage, had heard it too. With
lowered head and swaying neck he stood listening.
The next instant the galloping dogs swung over the
ridge. Behind them came the sledge with a fur-clad
figure shouting and brandishing the long whip. At
the top of their lungs the boys screamed, shouted and
yelled. Forgetting their precarious position, they
leaped to their feet and waved their arms. Unavik’s
sharp eyes had taken in the situation at a glance.
Midway in its mad career, he overturned the sledge
and swung it sidewise. The dogs, suddenly arrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in their race, tumbled head over heels, and the next
second, Unavik was among them, slashing through the
thongs and traces and shouting commands.</p>

<p>Already the scent of the bear had reached the dogs’
nostrils. With stiff hairs bristling on their shoulders
they hurled themselves forward. Like a pack
of great, tawny wolves they came plunging towards
the bear. At their heels came Unavik, his old musket
in his hands. As the bear turned to face the snapping,
snarling, savage ring of big dogs, the Eskimo
approached within a dozen feet, raised his heavy 50-caliber
Remington and fired at the bear’s broad chest.</p>

<p>With a gurgling roar the great beast lurched forward,
struck wildly with his paws at the dogs and
sank lifeless on the snow.</p>

<p>“Gee Christopher!” cried Tom, as the two boys
scrambled from their perch. “It was lucky you came,
Unavik. Another minute and we’d have been killed.”</p>

<p>The Eskimo grinned. “Sure Mike!” he replied.
“How you feller likeum hunt bear?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t,” declared Jim. “He hunted us. My,
but isn’t he a whopper!”</p>

<p>“Mos’ big all same Ukla, me say,” agreed Unavik.
“Why you no killum?”</p>

<p>“That’s what gets me,” said Tom. “We hit him all
right. Look, there back of the shoulder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>But when the boys stooped and examined the wound
they knew instantly why the bear had not died from
their shots and why he had not become exhausted
from the wounds. Their bullets had struck the edge
of the massive shoulder blade and had glanced, tearing
a great strip of hide and flesh away, splintering
the edge of the bone, but inflicting no mortal injury,
and not even disabling the leg. No wonder the bear
had been able to chase the boys, although the shock
of the bullets had temporarily knocked him out.</p>

<p>Hardly had the boys satisfied themselves of this
when the second sledge arrived. The Eskimos gathered
about, chattering and exclaiming. All agreed
that it was the biggest bear they had ever seen. To
carry the huge carcass to the village was impossible
and so, as one of the men went with the boys to the
dead reindeer, Unavik and the other Eskimo set to
work to skin the bear. After having cut a haunch
from the beast, and with its skin and the deer loaded
on the sledge, the party started on their return to the
village.</p>

<p>Now that it was all over and their excitement had
subsided, the two boys felt weak and shaky and found
it impossible to trudge through the snow. For a while
they gamely stuck it out, but at last they were obliged
to give in. Throwing themselves upon the sleds they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
lay almost as helpless and motionless as the dead
animals beside them.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing in the village that night,
for the death of a bear is always celebrated. The
rest of the beast’s carcass had been brought in and the
Eskimos gorged themselves on the meat. Throughout
the night the drums throbbed, the Eskimos’ voices
rose and fell in discordant chants and, grotesque in
their fur garments, they danced and pranced while
the dogs howled in unison.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet this is when the men don’t work or the
women comb their hair for three days,” laughed Tom
as, fully recovered from their exciting afternoon,
they watched the merrymaking.</p>

<p>But there was a fly in the boys’ ointment, so to
speak. When they had told their story to the captain
he had grown serious and had told the boys that
hereafter they were not to go any distance from the
village alone under any circumstances.</p>

<p>“I’d feel nice going home and telling your folks a
bear or a wolf had eaten you up, wouldn’t I?” said
the skipper. “You may be owners, but I’m responsible
for you, and hereafter you take one of the
Eskimos and a pack of dogs with you if you stir from
the village. I know you came through safely this
time, but you might not be so lucky next time. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
don’t you dare stay alone out there. If your Eskimo
goes anywhere, you go too. Now, that’s final.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the boys, “we’ll be careful.”</p>

<p>While they knew the captain was looking after their
safety, it galled the two boys to think that their sled
trips must be chaperoned by a native and that they
were being treated like “tenderfeet,” as Tom put it.
But as they looked at the enormous shaggy skin—twelve
feet from nose to tail—and thought how it
would look upon the polished floor of the house in
Fair Haven, all else was forgotten in their pride at
having secured such a trophy, and their hearts beat
more quickly as vivid memories of their narrow
escape from such a terrible death came to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">AN ARCTIC CHRISTMAS</span></h2>

<p>Although the boys’ fathers had painted a
picture of long and dreary months in the
Arctic with the ship frozen in, and only the
whalemen and Eskimos for company, the boys found
it far from dull.</p>

<p>To be sure there were many days when snowstorms
raged and the wind howled, and no one stirred from
the long house on the deck. But even then there were
things to amuse and interest the boys. A number of
the native Eskimos were usually there, as well as
those from Hebron, and the two lots of tribesmen
were never tired of holding competitions of skill or
strength. Gathered in a circle about the contestants,
the whalemen and the boys would clap and applaud,
shout encouragement and roar with laughter as the
stocky natives struggled and strained in friendly,
good-natured contests. Often a prize of tobacco,
knives, clothes, or hatchets would be offered to the
winner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the contests were wonderfully novel and
amusing and sometimes the two boys would try their
hands at them, much to the merriment of the assembled
men.</p>

<p>One game which was a favorite with the Eskimos
was a sort of tug of war. Kneeling on the deck with
heads close together, the competitors would have their
friends tie their necks together by a rope or thong,
and then, at a signal, would strain and tug and heave,
each trying his utmost to drag the other over a chalk
line on the deck. Evidently there was a knack in it,
aside from strength of neck muscles; for very often
the smaller and weaker man would win. The boys
after one or two trials decided this was too strenuous
a contest.</p>

<p>Another game consisted of two Eskimos locking
arms and legs together while perched on a third man’s
back, and then trying to see who could dismount the
other. Hard bumps and thumps always resulted,
but the men’s heads were well padded with their mops
of coarse black hair, and they always rose grinning
and as good-natured as ever.</p>

<p>The greatest sport was to see the Eskimos attempt
to box. The whalemen were always boxing, and
after watching the white men for some time, the Eskimos
wanted to try their skill. At their antics as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
struck blindly at each other, dodged blows, ki-yied
and shouted, twisted and turned, and often fell sprawling,
the boys and the assembled whalemen roared
until they almost choked.</p>

<p>But the Eskimos were apt imitators, they had unlimited
perseverance, and gradually several of them
began to develop skill in the use of the gloves and before
long there were acknowledged champions among
them. The sport-loving whalemen matched them up
as lightweights, welterweights, and featherweights;
for not a native could be found who, by any stretch
of imagination, could be classed as a heavyweight.
So interested did the crew become that several of the
whalemen took to training their favorites; arguments
over their respective merits grew heated, and the men
bet recklessly on the results of the bouts. They even
nicknamed the Eskimos, and Tom and Jim roared until
their sides ached as Cap’n Pem would get excited
and leaping up would pound his wooden leg on the
deck and shout, “Wallop him, Dempsey! That’s a
good one!” while Mike, whose favorite was a bull-necked,
fat-faced, bow-legged man from Hebron whom
he called Sullivan, would shout derogatory remarks
about “Dempsey” and would dance wildly about the
improvised ring, urging his man to the utmost.</p>

<p>While such things served to pass the time in bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
weather and at night, the boys found far more pleasure
with their dogs and their Eskimo friends ashore.
Day after day they went hunting, always accompanied
by Unavik or some other Eskimo. They were
woefully disappointed in not finding musk oxen or
another bear, but they often secured reindeer; and the
pile of fox, wolf and seal skins which they reserved
for themselves increased rapidly. The crew, too,
went hunting, each man accompanied by an Eskimo,
and each week the <i>Narwhal’s</i> cargo increased in value
by many hundreds of dollars. Very often also the
men had better luck than the boys, and several fine
bearskins were brought in which spurred the boys
to still greater efforts and longer trips. At last they
were rewarded. They had traveled much farther
than they had ever been before, following the valley
of the river, and had reached a district of low, sharp
hills, narrow ravines and small, rock-strewn valleys.
Suddenly Unavik, who was with them, halted his
dogs, peered intently at the snow, and pointed to
a trampled trail leading across the valley.</p>

<p>“Musk ox!” he exclaimed. “Me say him feller
near. Mebbe shootum.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, do you think we can?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Sure, Mike, mebbe,” replied the Eskimo as he
unharnessed his dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Cautioning the boys to be silent, Unavik crept to
the top of the nearest ridge and peered about. No
living thing was in sight. Then, with eyes on the
tracks of the animals, he descended the ridge while
the dogs, sniffing and whimpering, strained at their
thongs, and the boys, thrilled with excitement, followed
at the Eskimo’s heels. Along the little defile
the trail led, over another ridge, through another
valley, and up a third hill. “Him feller near,”
declared Unavik, pointing to bare patches of rock
and moss where the animals had scraped away the
snow.</p>

<p>Very cautiously the three crawled among the ice-covered
bowlders up the hill. The boys could
scarcely restrain a cry of delight as they peered between
the rocks and saw a dozen big, shaggy beasts
pawing in the snow and nuzzling in the moss beneath.</p>

<p>Jim was about to raise his rifle, for the musk
oxen were within easy range, when Unavik stopped
him with a gesture and rapidly slipped the thongs
that bound the dogs together. The next instant the
huskies were bounding towards the surprised musk
oxen who threw up their heads, armed with huge
broad horns, snorted, and with one accord tore off
up the valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gee, now we’ve lost them!” exclaimed Tom in
disgust. “Why didn’t you let us shoot, Unavik?”</p>

<p>The Eskimo grinned but said nothing. Beckoning
to the boys he turned and ran rapidly along the
ridge in the direction the animals had gone. Presently,
to the boys’ ears, came the barks, yelps, and
growls of the dogs. Rounding a rocky hillock they
came in sight of the pack, nipping and snapping at
the musk oxen who had formed in a close ring with
lowered threatening horns towards their enemies.</p>

<p>With their long, shaggy, black hair, their wild,
reddened eyes and great recurved needle-pointed
horns, the creatures looked very savage indeed and
the dogs knew full well that death lurked in that ring
of broad heads and sharp horns. These were no
timid reindeer and, though the wolflike huskies now
and then took chances and dashed at the snorting,
stamping creatures before them, none dared approach
too closely.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the oxen uttered a low bellow,
plunged forward and, before the dogs could retreat,
the wicked horns swung to right and left, and a
howling husky was tossed high in air to fall dead
and bleeding on the snow.</p>

<p>“Golly, they’re <em>some</em> fighters!” exclaimed Jim in
a low voice. “Come on, Tom, let’s shoot!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But before the boys could fire, the musk oxen had
scented them. Forgetting the dogs in their greater
fear of human beings, they dashed off in a close-packed
bunch with the huskies at their heels. Once
more Unavik and the boys raced after them, and
once more the dogs brought the animals to bay.
This time Unavik led the way behind bowlders and
snowdrifts down the wind. All unsuspected by the
wild cattle, the three approached within easy range
and picking out two of the biggest bulls, the boys
fired.</p>

<p>At the double report the musk oxen again dashed
off and, confused by the dogs, they came galloping,
plunging, directly towards the three hunters. Before
the astonished boys realized what had occurred, the
great shaggy beasts were upon them. There was no
time to reload and fire, no time to rise and run.
Like an avalanche the stampeded creatures bore
down upon the frightened boys. With lowered
heads, rolling eyes, steaming nostrils and swinging
horns they came. With terrified yells the boys threw
themselves to one side, rolled among the rocks, and
buried their heads, faces down, in the snow. All
about them pounded the galloping hoofs. Tom
screamed as he was struck a terrific blow and hurled
aside. Over them they heard the panting breaths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the loud snorts and the low bellows of the creatures.
Each second they expected to feel the sharp hooked
horns ripping through their garments and their
flesh.</p>

<p>But in an instant it was over. The musk oxen
had passed; the boys were unhurt, and slowly, and
with wondering expressions, they cautiously raised
themselves as the pack of dogs raced by.</p>

<p>“Jiminy crickets!” exclaimed Jim, “I thought we
<em>were</em> goners that time.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, yes!” assented Tom. “One of ’em stepped
on me, but I guess these furs saved me. Say,
what’s the matter with us? We didn’t kill a single
one.”</p>

<p>“Search me,” replied Jim, “I don’t see how we
missed.”</p>

<p>“Me say hitum, sure Mike!” cried Unavik who
was searching the trampled snow where the beasts
had passed.</p>

<p>The boys hurried to his side and glancing down,
saw big splashes of crimson on the snow. Evidently
they had not missed. Racing after the Eskimo they
hurried as fast as they could travel towards the distant
barking of the dogs. As they leaped the crest
of a hummock, Unavik uttered a sharp cry, and the
boys shouted with delight as they saw a big black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
bull lying half buried in a snow drift where he had
fallen.</p>

<p>“We got one anyway!” cried Tom as they hurried
on. “Say, we <em>are</em> in luck!”</p>

<p>Once again they found the oxen at bay and, this
time when they fired, two of the creatures were left
behind when the herd galloped off.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s enough!” declared Jim, as panting
and utterly exhausted the boys seated themselves on
one of the dead oxen. “I’m all in. These clothes
were never made for sprinting.”</p>

<p>“Get the dogs, Unavik,” said Tom. “No use in
killing more. We can’t even get these three in to the
village. We’ll wait here for you.”</p>

<p>The Eskimo started off, but there was no need
for him to recall his pack. The musk oxen were
thoroughly frightened and demoralized and had fled
over hill and dale into the vast white waste, and
the dogs, realizing that the creatures could not be
brought to bay again with the scent of blood
behind them, came trotting back towards the dead
oxen.</p>

<p>It was, as Tom said, impossible to carry the three
creatures to the village and so, having regained their
breaths, the two boys and Unavik set to work skinning
the two oxen. It was a hard slow job, but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
last it was done and the boys straightened their aching
backs and eased their cramped muscles.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over!” exclaimed Jim. “But how on
earth can we carry those skins and heads back?
They weigh pretty near a ton, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>Unavik grinned. “Me say plenty easy,” he remarked
and rolling the skins in a bundle with the
hair inside he lashed them firmly with the tough
sinews from the creatures’ legs, attached his dogs
to the whole and with a sharp command sent the
huskies galloping over the snow with the bundle of
skins sliding like a sled behind them.</p>

<p>“Golly, that’s easy!” cried Tom. “But I’d never
have thought of it.”</p>

<p>With the musk ox trail to guide them, the three
had no difficulty in locating the sledge and having
harnessed the dogs they drove the team back to the
first ox they had killed. This Unavik dressed and,
after a deal of hard work, the body was loaded on
the sled and the triumphant and elated boys turned
towards the distant village. It was a long, hard
tramp, the boys were tired, and except when traveling
down a steep slope, they could not rest by leaping on
to the sledge, for the dogs had all they could do to
haul the vehicle with its load. But the boys did not
complain. With three musk oxen to their credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
they could well afford to undergo some hardship;
but over and over again they were forced to halt
and rest. As a result, it was nearly midnight when
they at last saw the rounded igloos and the ghostly
outline of the schooner in the flickering light of the
aurora, and with heartfelt thanks, they reached the
end of their journey.</p>

<p>“Where’n tarnation ye been?” demanded Cap’n
Pem, who was the first to see them. “I swan, ye’ll
have us all plumb crazy worryin’ over ye.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have worried,” declared Tom, “Unavik
was with us.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, he’s jes’ as bad as ye be,” declared
the old whaleman. “H’ain’t got no sense ’tall.
What——”</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Captain Edwards, interrupting the
old whaleman. “You boys are late. Just beginning
to think we’d have t’ start out to search for you.
Have any luck?”</p>

<p>“Three musk oxen,” replied Jim. “We’re pretty
near starved.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet ye be,” cried Cap’n Pem. “Blow me if
ye ain’t reg’lar hunters. Fetched in three o’ the
critters, eh? Waall, I’ll be sunk!”</p>

<p>As the half-famished boys ate ravenously, they
told their story of the hunt to the men and officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and then, having been unanimously acclaimed the
champion hunters of the ship, they crawled into their
bunks, snuggled among their furs, and were instantly
sound asleep.</p>

<p>So rapidly had the time passed that the boys
could scarcely believe that half the winter was over.
As Tom, on the morning after their musk ox hunt,
started to write down the events of the preceding day
in his diary, he uttered a surprised ejaculation.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Jim, it’s only two weeks till Christmas!”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Jim. “Gee, I didn’t realize it.
We’ll have to have a celebration. I wonder what
they do up here.”</p>

<p>“Of course we celebrate,” the captain assured
them when they spoke to him about the holidays.
“Reckon we’d better be gettin’ ready pretty quick.”</p>

<p>So for the next ten days every one aboard the
<i>Narwhal</i> was busy. There was the same delightful
mystery in the air as at home; preparations for the
Christmas festivities proceeded rapidly; and the boys
were amazed to discover what resources the men
and the schooner possessed. Mike and the carpenter
worked early and late at building a miniature whaling
ship to serve in place of a Christmas tree. The
grinning black cook labored from morning until
night—or rather from breakfast until bedtime—baking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
cakes and pies, making mysterious dishes,
and boiling great kettles of molasses for candy, and
from dinner until nearly midnight, the boys and men
had glorious fun pulling the molasses candy, roasting
quarts and pecks of peanuts, and popping hundreds
of ears of corn. Half shyly the rough whalemen
brought out clumsily wrapped packages and placed
them on the pile of gifts on the chart table. Even
the Eskimos seemed to catch the spirit of Christmas,
and grinned and clucked and chuckled as they saw
the preparations going on, for they had seen Christmas
celebrations before and knew what a fine time
was in store.</p>

<p>Two days before the great day, the completed
model of the ship was set up in the deck house, and
all hands busied themselves stringing the pop corn
in its rigging, hanging the presents to the yards and
masts, piling candy wrapped in bright-colored paper
on the decks, and attaching colored candles along
the bulwarks, up the shrouds, and along the yards.</p>

<p>“Say,” cried Jim, as the boys surveyed the completed
substitute for a tree with approval. “Every
one’ll have to hang up his stocking. Look at that
heap of presents!”</p>

<p>At first the men demurred, trying to laugh off
their embarrassment, but the boys insisted, the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
seconded them, Mr. Kemp added his pleas, and
old Pem chuckled.</p>

<p>“’Spec’ I’m a ol’ fool!” he exclaimed. “But I
rec’on we kin all ’ford to be kids, come Christmas.
I’m a-goin’ fer to hang my stockin’!”</p>

<p>Stumping to his cabin, the old whaleman returned
carrying a huge rabbit skin under-boot. “On’y
stockin’ I got,” he declared as all burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, b’gorra, ’tis lucky for ould Santa that yez
have but wan lig thin!” cried Mike. “Faith an’ wid
two av thim there’d not be a prisint for the rist av
us.”</p>

<p>Now that Cap’n Pem had started the fun, the men
quickly caught the spirit. Shouts of merriment,
roars of laughter and good-natured chaffing floated
over the frozen wastes from the schooner as the whalemen
brought out socks, fur boots and heavy woolen
stockings, and hung them in a long row along one
side of the deck house, while the captain and the boys
hurried back and forth filling them with bundles and
packages.</p>

<p>Christmas day dawned clear and cold. Not a
breath of wind stirred the frost filled air. The thermometer
registered 45° below zero and the boys
noted that the sun rose above the frozen plain of the
bay at 9.30. Jumping from their bunk, the two boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ran hither and thither, wishing a “Merry Christmas”
to every one. Presently the men came trooping in
and seated themselves at the long table loaded with
the Christmas breakfast.</p>

<p>The meal over, the Eskimos began to arrive, for
all had been invited to spend the day aboard the
schooner. Soon the deck house was packed with the
grinning men and laughing girls and women all
decked out in their richest furs and most elaborate
costumes, every one carrying some bundle of fur or
skin.</p>

<p>Then peanuts and pop corn were passed around,
which the Eskimos munched and enjoyed hugely.
Presently the captain jumped upon a chair and announced
that there would be a dance. Swanson appeared
with a much battered concertina, the carpenter
brought out a wheezy fiddle, the ebony-skinned
cook arrived with a banjo, and, to complete the
orchestra, Nate produced a mouth organ.</p>

<p>Whatever the tune was—if tune it could be called—the
boys never knew, but the men cared not a jot
and seemed perfectly satisfied. Presently the deck
was covered with couples, each dancing a different
step, all laughing and all as happy as a crowd of
youngsters. Tom and Jim roared with merriment
as old Cap’n Pem seized a stout Eskimo woman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
started to waltz with her. Mike took the center of
the deck and executed a weird hornpipe which
brought down thunderous applause, and Mr. Kemp,
with blackened face and with a strip of gaudy calico
wrapped about his long legs and a gay bandanna on
his head, pranced up and down in a cakewalk.</p>

<p>Then the Eskimos had their turn. The skin drums
throbbed and boomed, a man with a curious tambourinelike
instrument, like a thin drum filled with
pebbles, added to the din, and the natives pranced
around and around, chanting a weird song, stepping
high, twisting and turning and moving in intricate
figures.</p>

<p>Then came games, followed by boxing matches,
and the fun waxed fast and furious. Finally there
was a tug of war, Eskimos against whalemen, and
when, with wild shouts and yells, the Eskimos had
pulled their rivals an inch over the chalk line and
were declared the victors, Captain Edwards announced
that the presents would be given out.</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, there was a shout from the
companionway and every one turned and gaped in
astonishment, for there, pushing his way through the
narrow entrance was Santa Claus! Even the boys
were surprised, for Santa had been kept a profound
secret. Clad in a suit of brown wolfskin with ermine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
trimming, and with big sealskin boots on his feet,
the fat little fellow beamed upon all through his
voluminous white whiskers of bearskin, and entering
the deck house, tossed down his heavily loaded pack
and brushed the snow from his sleeves and shoulders.</p>

<p>At first no one recognized him, but at his first
words a roar of merriment burst from every one’s
lips. “Had a everlastin’ tough time a-gettin’ to ye,
clean up here!” he cried, striving ludicrously to
disguise his voice. “But I reckon I brung presents
fer all.”</p>

<p>“B’ the saints, ’tis the fursst toime Oi iver see a
wan-ligged Santa!” chuckled Mike. “But sure ’tis
a foine wan he do be afther makin’ at that.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the presents were distributed. There
were comfort bags for each member of the crew,
every bag containing buttons, thread, wax, combs
salve, thimbles, pins and a small mirror. Every
Eskimo woman received a bundle of bright-colored
cloth and a little package of beads. The girls were
given bead necklaces and gold plated rings. Each
native boy got a shiny new jackknife, and every Eskimo
man received a file and a plug of tobacco.
Then the presents piled around the ship were distributed,
and finally the men, sheepishly and flushing
like children, received their well filled stockings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and giggled and snickered like schoolgirls as they
unwrapped the packages.</p>

<p>The Eskimos had done their part also. The men
and boys were fairly loaded down with moccasins,
fur boots, carved ivory curios, selected skins and
similar things, while the natives were mad with delight
over the powder and lead, the matches, the
hatchets and knives, and the brass and iron they received.</p>

<p>Then came dinner, and such a dinner! There
was a roast haunch of reindeer, bear chops, musk ox
steaks, roast ptarmigan and potted hare. Even the
cranberry sauce was there, with mince and pumpkin
pies, and to cap the climax, a great steaming plum
pudding which the grinning cook brought triumphantly
in with its brandy sauce ablaze.</p>

<p>And the Eskimos at their table also had a feast.
The dainties so appreciated by the white men held
no attractions for the natives, and so their feast consisted
of canned fruits, thick tinned milk, and, to
their minds best of all, vast quantities of lard and
oleomargarine. Not until midnight did the celebration
end. When the last Eskimo had departed and
eight bells pealed through the night, all vowed that
this Christmas in the Arctic was the jolliest one they
had ever known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">FRIENDS IN NEED</span></h2>

<p>One morning Tom came on deck, glanced
ashore and rubbed his eyes. He could
hardly believe what he saw. Beyond the
igloos, several of the Eskimos were busily putting
up a skin tent on the shore.</p>

<p>“Golly, Jim!” he cried to his cousin. “Look,
there—they must know that spring’s coming.
They’re putting up their skin tents.”</p>

<p>“Cricky, so they are!” exclaimed Jim. “Say, I
didn’t know spring came so early.”</p>

<p>“Won’t be here for some spell yet,” laughed Mr.
Kemp who had overheard the boys. “You’re rushing
the season. Getting tired of winter?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” declared Tom. “We’re having
a bully time and I wouldn’t mind being frozen in
here for six months more. But if spring’s not near,
why are they moving ashore and putting up the skin
tents?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Going to mend some clothes,” replied the second
officer.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, you must think we’re easy,” laughed
Jim. “They could mend clothes in the igloos,
couldn’t they? What’s the joke?”</p>

<p>“No joke,” Mr. Kemp assured him. “And of
course they <em>could</em> mend clothes in the igloos—only
they don’t think so. That is, some kinds. You see,
these Eskimos believe there’s a water god and a land
god—sorta spirit I reckon—and each one’s boss of
the critters where he reigns. So they think if they
mend clothes made of sea critters’ skins on shore,
the water spirit’ll be peeved, and if they mend things
made of land animals’ hides on the ice, t’other god’ll
be vexed. I’ll bet, if you was over to that tent,
you’d find the old lady sewin’ at a shirt or somethin’
made of bear or reindeer or fox, or some other
land thing’s hide.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is the funniest thing yet,” declared
Tom. “Come on, Jim, let’s go and see.”</p>

<p>They found that it was exactly as Mr. Kemp had
said. Inside the tent, two of the Eskimo women were
busily mending some garments which the boys at
once saw were made of wolf and deer skins. This
discovery aroused their interest and all of their spare
time was spent questioning the Eskimos about beliefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and habits. The two boys learned a great
number of most interesting things. All of these they
recorded in their notebooks, and once, as Tom was
busily writing down a folklore story, Newilic, who
had been watching him, asked what he was doing.
Tom explained as best he could and the Eskimo
grinned. Then, asking Tom to let him take the
book, the Iwilic<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> grasped the pencil in his fist,
screwed up his mouth, bent his eyes close to the
paper, and commenced to draw several pictures.
Presently he handed the book back to Tom and as the
boys saw what the Eskimo had drawn they roared
with laughter. There, unmistakable and indescribably
quaint and funny, were the birds and animals
of the story with a stiff-jointed, woodeny Eskimo
among them.</p>

<p>From that time on the boys had Newilic illustrate
all the stories they recorded, and the result was a
collection of the most fascinating pictures they had
ever seen. Both boys declared they would have them
bound and the stories printed with them as soon as
they reached home.</p>

<p>Of course the two boys never lost their interest in
hunting and one day, when out for meat for the
schooner’s table, Jim killed an Arctic hare, and picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
him up, was amazed to see that he was speckled
with brown.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he shouted to Tom. “Now I know
spring’s coming. The hares are getting brown.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Amook forgot to rub his hands all over
him,” laughed Tom. “You know one swallow doesn’t
make a summer, and I don’t believe one hare with
brown spots makes a spring. Let’s get another one
and see if he’s the same way.”</p>

<p>But oddly enough, now that the boys wanted a hare,
there were none to be found. Finally, tiring of
searching for them, the two turned back. As they
crossed a little swale, a pair of ptarmigan fluttered
up and Tom bagged them.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I guess you’re right,” he cried as he picked
up the birds. “These fellows have got brown feathers
on them.”</p>

<p>“Yep, ain’t no doubt of it,” declared Cap’n Pem
when the boys returned to the schooner and showed
the brown feathers and hairs to the old whaleman.
“Can’t fool these here critters, by gum! I’ll bet ye,
ye’ll see the geese a-honkin’ back afore long.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the hare and the ptarmigan,
as well as many other creatures the boys brought
in, were all assuming their summer coats of gray and
brown, there was no let up in the biting wind. Snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
storms came and piled the drifts higher, and the
thermometer hovered around the thirty or forty mark
below zero.</p>

<p>Then one day the boys came on deck to find a soft
wind blowing from the south, water was dripping
from the icicles on the <i>Narwhal’s</i> rigging, the sky
was clear and blue, and there was an unmistakable
feel of spring in the air. Day after day the south
wind blew, and the sky was cloudless and though
the nights were cold, the ice and snow thawed rapidly
during the short days. One morning a faint, faraway
sound caused the boys to look up, and they
saw a little V-shaped string of black specks winging
swiftly across the sky.</p>

<p>“There are the geese!” cried Tom. “I guess
spring really is here.”</p>

<p>Evidently the Eskimos were of the same mind,
for they were all busy, erecting skin tents and moving
their household belongings from the igloos to
their new homes. Before long the low, rounded
houses of ice were deserted.</p>

<p>“Looks like the ice might break up pretty soon,”
remarked Captain Edwards. “That is, if this
weather holds. What do you think, Pem?”</p>

<p>The old whaleman squinted at the sky, sniffed the
wind and scratched his head. “I reckon ’twill,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
replied at last. “But I’ll be sunk if I hanker arter
a early thaw. Mos’ gin’rally there’s a’ all-fired,
dod-gasted freeze arterwards an’ the ice buckles an’
raises Sam Hill. I’ve seen many a good ship stove
an’ sent to Davy Jones by a freeze arter the ice breaks.
No, sir, gimme a late spring an’ no danger of it
a-freezin’ solid arterwards.”</p>

<p>“Hmm,” muttered the skipper. “Yep, I know
that, Pem, but if the ice breaks we’ll clear it away
about the schooner and then she’d ought to stand it.
Clear water’ll freeze smooth black ice and won’t do
any harm.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe ye will, an’ mebbe ye won’t,” grumbled
the old man. “Course I ain’t a-lookin’ fer trouble
but I’ll bet ye we git it.”</p>

<p>A few days after this conversation the boys were
wakened by a report like a cannon and started up.
“What’s that?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Ice breakin’ up,” called back Mr. Kemp from the
next berth. “Reckon she’ll be a-goin’ good by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the night the crackling reports,
dull crashes and sharp detonations woke the
boys a score of times, and when they reached the deck
the next morning, they gazed with amazement at the
vast plain of white that marked the bay. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
yesterday it had been solid ice—rough, hummocky
and rugged—it was now broken, and cracked in every
direction. Narrow strips of dark water could be
seen here and there, and the mass rose and fell in
undulations like the swell of the ocean.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! it’s broken!” cried Tom. “Now we’ll
soon be getting away.”</p>

<p>It did indeed look as though the bay would soon
be cleared of ice, for the tide or current and the wind
were slowly but surely moving the ice away from the
land. Already a stretch of fifty feet of water separated
the igloos from the shore, and along the beach
tiny waves were lapping at the shingle. For the first
time in many months, the boys felt the schooner
gently rising and falling beneath their feet. But Tom
and Jim did not know the treacherous Arctic weather.
Two nights later they were aroused by shouts and
cries, the sound of hurrying feet, and crashing shivering
blows that shook the schooner from stem to
stern. At first they thought the <i>Narwhal</i> had gone
adrift and was on the rocks. Hurrying into their garments
they rushed on deck to gaze upon a terrific,
wild and magnificent sight. The wind had shifted
and was blowing half a gale from the east and the
broken ice, that had been drifting out of the bay for
the past three days, was now being driven back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Tossing on the waves, the great masses of gleaming
ice came in, grinding together, crashing like thunder
as one collided with another, bumping and roaring
as they lifted and fell upon the seas. In a vast solid
rampart, the upended jagged cakes were approaching
the <i>Narwhal</i>, and already she was surrounded by
scores of the cakes—huge, sharp-edged bits of floe
twenty feet or more in thickness, and hurled like battering
rams by wind and waves.</p>

<p>Instantly, the boys realized the peril the schooner
was in. Each time a great cake was flung against
the stout ice sheathing of her hull, the <i>Narwhal</i>
shivered and trembled. It seemed impossible
that any vessel could withstand the steady buffeting,
the constant impacts, of the tossing cakes.</p>

<p>Shouting, and yelling, the men and the Eskimos
labored, striving to ward off the ice with poles, by
lowering great rope fenders over the sides, and by
paying out cable, but their puny efforts made no impression
on the irresistible oncoming ice. Presently,
however, the boys noticed that there were fewer
shocks, that the blows seemed less severe and then
they saw the reason. The first cakes of ice had
reached the shore, others had piled upon them,
back of these the oncoming ice was checked and, unable
to move farther, the countless thousands of heaving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
crashing, grinding cakes were jammed together
and the schooner was locked fast in their embrace.</p>

<p>“Gosh! that <em>was</em> a narrow escape!” cried Jim. “But
I guess we’re all right now.”</p>

<p>“All right!” burst out Mr. Kemp. “Here’s where
we’re a-goin’ to get it good an’ plenty. If the <i>Narwhal</i>
ain’t stove it’ll be nothin’ short of a miracle.”</p>

<p>For a moment the boys could not see where the
danger lurked and every one was too busy to answer
the questions they longed to ask. But presently they
understood. The gale, the heavy seas outside the
bay and the tide were all pushing with terrific force
against that vast mass of millions of tons of ice, and
the schooner was gripped within it as in the jaws of a
titanic vise. Only her hull of oak and pine, a mere
egg shell in that stupendous field of ice, lay between
the cakes, and no fabric built by human hands
could withstand that awful pressure.</p>

<p>With sickening creaks the timbers and planks began
to give. With horrified eyes the boys saw the
stout sides and bulwarks bending and buckling inwards.
The heavy oak rail parted, splintered and
ripped like a match stick. With a report like a gunshot
the decks sprang into the air and rose in a steep
hill-like ridge above the shattered bulwarks.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Jim, it’s all over with the old <i>Narwhal</i>!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
cried Tom, scarcely able to realize that the stout old
schooner had met her fate at last. “Now what <em>will</em>
we do?”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the boys were thrown headlong
on to the ripped deck and with a terrific lurch the
schooner’s stern reared high in air. She careened
terribly, and a moment later was lying almost on her
beam ends on the top of the floe which had forced
its way beneath her keel. Captain Edwards, old
Pem and Mr. Kemp were shouting and yelling orders
while the Eskimos who had seen their plight from the
shore came hurrying over the ice to help. Soon
every one was laboring like mad, unloading the cargo,
getting out stores and supplies and preparing to
desert the schooner, for all knew, that should the
wind shift and the ice go out, the <i>Narwhal</i> would
plunge to the bottom like a lump of lead.</p>

<p>Rapidly the casks of oil, the bales of whalebone,
the bundles of skins, and the sacks of walrus ivory
were lowered over the schooner’s sides. In a constant
stream the Eskimos’ sledges went back and
forth between the stove schooner and the shore, carrying
the salvaged goods which were piled in a great
mound well back from the beach.</p>

<p>At last everything movable had been saved. The
spars and sails, the chains and cables, the blocks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
tackle and the running rigging were stripped from
the <i>Narwhal</i> and with lumber hastily torn from the
long deck house a shed was built over the pile of
valuables and supplies.</p>

<p>“Gee, we’re marooned here now,” cried Jim when
the last sledge had come from the schooner and her
sorrowing crew had tramped over the hummocky
ice and stood gazing at the pitiful-looking ship which
had served them so well.</p>

<p>“Reckon we won’t have to stay here long,” said
Captain Edwards. “The <i>Ruby</i>’s up to Nepic Inlet
and, if we can make her, we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Ruby</i>?” queried Tom. “What’s she?”</p>

<p>“Little brigantine out o’ Nova Scotia,” replied
the skipper. “Bluenose sealer. Guess her skipper’ll
be willin’ to come in here an’ pick up this stuff
of ourn an’ give us a lift to port.”</p>

<p>“But how can we get to her?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Sleds,” replied the captain. “’Tain’t over a hundred
miles by land to the inlet an’ we can make it
all right. Snow’s still good enough for sleddin’.”</p>

<p>Since another warm spell and a thaw might arrive
at any moment, and make it impossible to travel
over the slushy snow, no time was to be lost. Within
two hours from the time the crew had come ashore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
all were on their way across the snow-covered land
toward Nepic Inlet and the <i>Ruby</i>.</p>

<p>Leading the party was Amaluk, with his sledge
laden with necessities, the men’s personal belongings,
food, and supplies. Behind him came team after
team and the schooner’s men and officers. In the
rear were the two boys with their own dog team,
their sledge laden with their trophies, and with
Unavik a few paces ahead of them.</p>

<p>Although the snow had been softened by the warm
spell, the change in wind and temperature had frozen
a hard crust upon it, and sledding was easy and rapid.
But the heavily loaded sledges broke through here and
there and the boys, bringing up the rear, found that
they could travel far easier by swinging to one
side on to the unbroken crust. Often, for several
miles, they were out of sight of the others, for they
made detours around hills and deep drifts and once
or twice stopped to shoot game. They had no fear of
going astray for the shrill shouts of the Eskimos, the
cracking of whips, and the yelps of the dogs were
borne plainly to them on the strong easterly
wind.</p>

<p>They had traveled in this way for several hours
when Tom, who was running ahead, halted and signaled
the dogs to stop. “Look here, Jim,” he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
“there are reindeer near. See, here’s where they’ve
been scraping away the snow and feeding.”</p>

<p>“Golly, that’s so,” assented Jim as he saw the bits
of moss on the white surface and the bare spots where
the animals had pawed away the snow from a deep
bed of moss.</p>

<p>“Let’s go after them!” suggested Tom. “They
may be near, and Captain Edwards said to get meat
if we could, to help out the provisions.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” cautioned Jim. “You know he told
us not to go off alone.”</p>

<p>“But that was different,” argued Tom. “He meant
not to go off on long trips. There’s no danger in
this. We can’t get lost. It’ll be dead easy to find
the others’ trail, or follow our own back. See, it’s
plain as can be.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess there’s no danger of that,” admitted
Jim. “All right, come on, but if we don’t find the
deer soon, we’ll have to come back.”</p>

<p>Urging their dogs forward, the boys followed the
deer’s trail and presently, by the dogs’ yelps and
growls and the way they strained at their traces, the
boys knew they were on a fresh scent, and that the
deer could not be far away. The trail led up a narrow
circuitous valley, and as the marks of the reindeer’s
hoofs became more and more distinct, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
bits of moss where the animals had stopped to feed
were fresher, the boys knew they were nearing the
herd, and halted their dogs.</p>

<p>“Let’s look over that ridge before we go farther,”
suggested Tom. “They may be in the next hollow.”</p>

<p>Crawling up the low ridge, the boys peered over
and to their joy saw a dozen reindeer lying down and
resting. Hurrying to the dogs, the boys unharnessed
them, looped the neck thongs together and led the
pack to near the summit of the hill. Then, unleashing
them, they let them go. With loud barks
and growls the dogs rushed down at the surprised
deer.</p>

<p>Leaping to their feet the reindeer, as always,
formed a defensive ring, and while they were busy
keeping off the snapping dogs, the boys slipped
around the hill to get within easy range. So intent
were the deer upon their four-footed enemies that the
boys crept within fifty yards and brought down two
of the creatures. It was almost as simple and as
little sport as killing domestic cattle but the boys were
out after meat and not for sport and, having all they
needed, they ran towards the herd, yelling and shouting.</p>

<p>Instantly the survivors turned and fled, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
dogs, after chasing them a short distance, came loping
back to the dead deer.</p>

<p>“We can’t carry both these, as they are,” said
Tom. “And we can’t afford to waste them. Let’s
dress them and leave the heads and horns. We have
better ones than these and the meat’s what we want
most.”</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to,” agreed Jim, and at once the
two set to work.</p>

<p>Although the boys had assisted Unavik and the
other Eskimos in dressing deer and musk oxen, they
had never before tried it alone and they soon found
that it was a hard and difficult undertaking. The
deer were heavy, the boys were no expert butchers
and the time passed more rapidly than they imagined.</p>

<p>As they finished the first deer and with grunts of
satisfaction stood up and looked about, they noticed
for the first time that the sky was overcast, that heavy
dun-gray clouds were scudding low overhead, and
that the wind had increased.</p>

<p>“Gee, I guess it’s going to storm!” exclaimed Jim.
“Don’t you think we’d better leave the other deer?”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Tom. “If it does storm, it won’t
make any difference. We’re not two miles from the
trail, and we can make it in a few minutes. Come
on, let’s get busy on this other fellow. If it storms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
it will be all the easier to catch up with the other
sledges. They’re slower than we are and may have
to stop.”</p>

<p>Once more the boys bent over the deer, cutting and
dressing the big carcass, and they had almost finished
when a few big snowflakes dropped upon the animal’s
hide.</p>

<p>“Golly, it’s snowing!” exclaimed Jim. “Say, we’ve
got to hurry!”</p>

<p>The snow was falling thick and fast by the time the
deer was dressed. Bending to the force of the wind,
the boys called to their dogs and started for the
sledge.</p>

<p>And then they realized that they had made a fatal
blunder. All intent upon dressing the deer they had
forgotten to knot the dogs’ thongs together, the
animals had been eating their fill of the offal from
the deer, and instinctively knowing a storm was approaching,
they were running nervously about, sniffing
the air and whining.</p>

<p>At Tom’s call, two of the dogs, old huskies who had
been long trained to obedience, came trotting to him,
but the others kept their distance.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’ll have to get them,” cried Jim, as
the boys knotted the thongs of the two together.
“Gosh, we <em>were</em> boobs not to have fastened them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>But as soon as the boys started towards the dogs,
the animals turned, dashed away with tails between
their legs and growled savagely.</p>

<p>“Confound them!” cried Tom, and yelling a command
in Eskimo he made a rush at the nearest dog.</p>

<p>With a sharp bark, and baring his teeth, the creature
leaped away and then, lifting his head in air,
he uttered a long wolflike howl and galloped off
over the hill with the pack at his heels.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other with real fear upon
their features.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone!” exclaimed Tom. “Now we <em>are</em>
in a fix.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to leave the deer and the sledge and
hike it,” declared Jim. “Maybe these two dogs can
lead us to the trail.”</p>

<p>It was their one chance and urging the dogs on,
the boys started back over the trail of their sledge.
But presently they were again at a loss. The rapidly
falling snow had now covered the runner marks, the
dogs seemed confused and ranged back and forth,
and the boys grew more and more frightened. Then
one of the dogs gave a glad yelp and with noses to
the snow they strained at the leading thongs.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” shouted Tom. “The dogs have
picked up the trail!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they’re going in exactly the opposite direction
I think they should have gone,” declared Jim.
“But I suppose they know.”</p>

<p>Over low hills and through valleys the dogs led the
boys while the blizzard raged. To the frightened
and nervous lads it seemed as if they had covered
twice the distance they had come when the dogs
barked loudly, sniffed the air and tugged harder than
ever at the leash.</p>

<p>“Guess the others are near now!” panted Tom,
striving to keep pace with the dogs. “They smell
something.”</p>

<p>The next instant the dogs cringed back, the hair
rose upon their necks and with tails drawn in they
whimpered as if in fear.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I wonder what’s up now!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Maybe a bear or wolf ahead,” suggested Jim,
cocking his rifle.</p>

<p>Anxiously the boys peered into the misty white
ahead and saw a low, irregular mound of snow with a
dark object projecting from it.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s that ahead?” queried Jim in low
tones.</p>

<p>“Looks like a sled covered with snow,” replied
Tom. “We’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>Approaching cautiously, while the dogs struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to keep back, the boys neared the little white mound,
and the next instant Jim uttered a piercing, frightened
cry and leaped back. Sticking stiffly up from
the snow was a human arm!</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s a man!” exclaimed Tom. “What are
you afraid of? Maybe he’s got lost or injured and
is not dead yet. Come on, let’s see.”</p>

<p>With fast beating hearts the boys, overcoming their
fears and nervousness, stepped close to the ominous
pile of snow. Tom grasped the outstretched fur-clad
arm.</p>

<p>But the next instant he let go, yelled, and jumped
away with a white face. The arm was frozen stiff.
It was the arm of a corpse!</p>

<p>“He—he’s dead!” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>Jim had now recovered himself. “Well, he won’t
hurt us if he is,” he reminded Tom. “It’s awful I
know, but we must find out who he is. It may be one
of our men.”</p>

<p>“Ugh, I hate to go near it!” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“So do I, but we’ve got to,” said Jim. “Come on,
Tom, we’re no babies or silly nervous girls. Brace
up.”</p>

<p>Striving to control their nervous fears, the boys
grasped the furs encasing that gruesome stiff arm and
tugged. Presently, with a horrible, terrifying motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the arm moved, the snow broke loose and the
boys involuntarily screamed and jumped away as the
body rolled over free from snow.</p>

<p>With wide eyes the two gazed upon the corpse
and backed still farther off. The body, clad in furs,
was that of a short, heavily built man, but the face,
swarthy, black-bearded and black-browed, was frightful
with the expression of fear and awful agony
stamped upon it. At the first glance the boys
saw with inexpressible horror that the whole side
of the skull was crushed in and the scalp ripped
off.</p>

<p>“Wha—wha—what killed him, I wo—wonder!”
stammered Tom, his teeth chattering.</p>

<p>Jim, summoning all his courage, took a step nearer.
“A bear!” he exclaimed, as he caught sight of a row
of great gashes in the man’s neck and the ripped and
torn back of the fur coat.</p>

<p>“Well, le—let’s get away from here,” stuttered
Tom. “We ca—can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>Without replying Jim turned and with boyish terror
of death gripping their hearts, and all their courage
flown, the two raced away from the body.</p>

<p>Not until they had topped the next rise did they
stop. Then, as they halted to regain their breaths,
they noticed that the snow had almost ceased, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
wind had gone down and they could see for a long
distance across the white landscape.</p>

<p>A moment later Tom gave a glad cry. “Look Jim!
Look!” he yelled. “We’re all right! see, over on
that second hill! There’s some of the men!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! you’re right!” yelled Tom as he too
caught sight of two sledges just topping a distant
ridge. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Yelling and shouting, the boys raced forward as
fast as the newly fallen snow would permit. As they
gained the summit of the second hill, they waved
their arms wildly. But they were already seen.
The dogs wheeled, the sleds swung around, and with
the two drivers riding the runners, they came racing
towards the boys.</p>

<p>As they came near Tom and Jim looked at each
other in surprise. The dogs, they knew, were not
the Eskimos’. One team was made up of huge black
and white Newfoundlands, the other of shaggy-haired,
magnificent, cream-colored huskies. At the boys’
first glance they were sure the men were utter strangers.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried the foremost man as his sledge,
drawn by the Newfoundlands, came to a halt close to
the boys. “What you kids doing out here?”</p>

<p>“We got separated from our party and lost,” explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Tom. “Our dogs broke away and cleared
out. You’re from the <i>Ruby</i> aren’t you?”</p>

<p>That any other white men should be here had never
occurred to the boys, and yet the men did not look
like whalemen or sailors. One was clad in a gay
Mackinaw, the other in furs; both were large, powerfully
built fellows and both had an alert, erect, peculiar
bearing that was very different from any whalemen
the boys had even seen. The man in the
Mackinaw was lean-jawed, with keen gray eyes and
wore a close-cropped mustache, while the other was
smooth-faced. Although both were as red as Indians
from wind and weather and had a week’s stubble
of beard upon their faces, they wore an indefinable
stamp of authority about them.</p>

<p>The boys remembered that Captain Edwards had
said the <i>Ruby</i> was a Nova Scotia ship, and as they
had never seen Nova Scotia seamen, they thought the
men before them might be the officers of the brigantine.</p>

<p>But at Tom’s words the man with the mustache
laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly!” he replied. “I’ve been taken for
most everything, but never for a sealer before. No,
we’re just ordinary Northwest Police. I’m Sergeant
Manley and this chap”—jerking his head towards his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
comrade—“is Private Campbell. We’re from Fort
Churchill. Been mushing it for two weeks. Looking
for the darkest-dyed rascal that ever disgraced
the Dominion. Fellow named Pierre Jacquet—Chippewa
half-breed. Wanted for murder and with
a thousand dollars reward for him, dead or alive.
Haven’t seen anything of him, have you?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. “No,” he replied. “But
say, Sergeant, we found a dead man back there. He’d
been killed by a bear or something. He was awful!
His head smashed in and torn to pieces! Gee, it
makes me feel sick to think of him.”</p>

<p>“Dead man!” snapped the Sergeant. “What did
he look like?”</p>

<p>“He was short and stout with a black beard and
bushy, black eyebrows,” replied Tom, “and had on a
suit of harp seal trimmed with blue fox.”</p>

<p>The Sergeant whistled. “Boys,” he cried, slapping
Tom on the back. “You’re lucky kids! Not
many can get lost and make a thousand dollars by
doing it!”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” asked Tom puzzled.</p>

<p>“Mean!” cried Sergeant Manley. “Why, that
dead man’s Jacquet. You’ve won a thousand dollars
by finding him. Come on, lead us to him.”</p>

<p>Now that the snow had ceased to fall it was easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to retrace their footsteps, and in a few minutes the
party was once more approaching the dead man.</p>

<p>“It’s Pierre all right!” declared the Sergeant, as
he glanced at the dead man.</p>

<p>“Aye, there’s nae doot o’ it,” agreed Campbell.
“Mon, but ’tis a fit endin’ he met.”</p>

<p>“Can’t take him back to the Fort,” commented the
Sergeant, half to himself. “Can’t bury him. Guess
we’ll have to leave him. Campbell, search his clothes
for anything that will identify him.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the private went through the pockets of
the dead outlaw, turning the body over as nonchalantly
as though it were a log, and presently he
straightened up.</p>

<p>“Aye, here’s his dirk an’ a wee bit o’ siller,” he
announced as he handed the Sergeant a long-bladed
hunting knife reddened with blood and a buckskin
bag of money.</p>

<p>“Must have shot at the bear and wounded him, and
had a hand-to-hand fight,” remarked Manley. “Used
his knife evidently, but the bear got in the finishing
blow. Hmm, there must be papers or jewelry or a
watch or something on him.”</p>

<p>Stooping, the Sergeant again examined the body,
stripping aside the furs, and presently rose with a
satisfied grunt. “Guess this is all we need,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as he showed a heavy, old-fashioned silver watch, a
bundle of letters and small book. “Nothing more to
do here,” he continued. “We’ll see you to the <i>Ruby</i>
now.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t leave our sledge,” objected Tom.
“It’s got all our things on it.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Manley stroked his mustache and bit his
lip as he hesitated. “All right,” he assented at last.
“Guess we can find it. You saved us a lot of hard
work by finding Jacquet, so we can afford to do our
bit.”</p>

<p>With keen, trained eyes the officers followed the
boys’ trail, half hidden though it was, and long before
Tom and Jim realized that they were near it,
private Campbell sighted the abandoned sled covered
deep with snow.</p>

<p>“Might as well take your meat, too,” said the Sergeant.
“These Newfoundlands can manage one deer
and we can load the other on your sled and hitch
your two huskies on with Campbell’s dogs to haul
it.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the deer were lashed to the
sledges, the boys’ dogs had been harnessed to Campbell’s
team, and with the boys riding, the dogs raced
forwards over the soft fresh snow.</p>

<p>“Have to give us your address so that reward can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
be sent you,” said the Sergeant as they dashed down a
long slope.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it,” declared Tom. “It belongs to
you and private Campbell, doesn’t it, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Jim. “I wouldn’t think of
taking it. Why, we just stumbled on the body by
chance and you’d have found it if we hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s being too generous,” declared the Sergeant.
“It belongs to you. We might have passed by and
never found the body.”</p>

<p>“Well, we want you to have it—even if you call
it a present—or to show our gratitude for finding
you and getting saved,” insisted Tom.</p>

<p>“I can’t thank you—only to say thanks awfully,”
declared Manley, “and I’ll tell the wife what a couple
of fine kids you are when I get back to the Fort.”</p>

<p>“Aye!” shouted the private. “Yon bit o’ siller’ll
come muckle handy i’ celebratin’ o’ a weddin’ wi’ a
bonny lass awaitin’ me i’ yon Fort.”</p>

<p>Then as the boys sped on, they talked with the
two stalwart guardians of His Majesty’s law in the
frozen wastes, and told them all about their trip,
their hunts, and the staving of the <i>Narwhal</i>, and even
of their former cruise in the <i>Hector</i>, to the Antarctic.</p>

<p>To all of this Campbell and his Sergeant listened
attentively, laughing gaily over Cap’n Pem and Mike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
now and then asking a question, uttering surprised
ejaculations as the boys told of their adventures, and
now and again glancing at each other and raising their
eyebrows as Tom and Jim told of the rich catch of
furs, hides, and ivory the <i>Narwhal</i> had made. Rapidly
the time passed. Untiringly the powerful dogs
raced on, until at last, Sergeant Manley raised his
fur-mittened hand and pointed ahead.</p>

<p>“Tinavik Cape,” he said. “See that conical hill?
Guess you’ll see your people when you get to the
ridge there.”</p>

<p>Down into a deep, wide valley the sledges sped;
across a broad frozen river, and up the farther slope,
and gaining the top of the sharp, high ridge the dogs
came to a standstill, panting and winded.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! We’re there!” shouted Tom as the
boys looked down from the hilltop. “There’s the
brigantine!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">SOUTHWARD HO!</span></h2>

<p>For a moment the little group paused on
the summit of the ridge, and gazed down
at the inlet with the brig floating amid the
great cakes of ice.</p>

<p>“Gosh, we weren’t far off after all!” exclaimed
Jim.</p>

<p>Sergeant Manley smiled. “You don’t have to be
far off to get lost up here,” he said, “and I’m blessin’
the day we met you. Best of luck all around.
Saved you boys, saved us the Lord alone knows how
many weeks of mushing it, and ended the hunt for
Jacquet.”</p>

<p>“Aye, an’ nae forgettin’ the tidy bit o’ siller
comin’ to our pockets,” put in the practical Campbell.</p>

<p>“Say, what <em>are</em> they doing on the shore?” cried
Tom who had been studying the scene intently.
“Look, they’ve got tents and I can see a lot of the
men there. Why aren’t they on the brig?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Sergeant Manley whipped out his glasses and focused
them on the shore of the inlet.</p>

<p>“Something queer!” he exclaimed. “Wonder if
the <i>Ruby’s</i> stove too. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>The next moment the powerful Newfoundlands
were tearing down the slope with the lighter, cream-colored
Eskimo dogs in the rear, and with the two
stalwart policemen riding the runners and “yip-yiing”
at the teams. Like the wind the sleds raced
down the steep hillside, and the two boys bent their
heads as the cold wind whistled across their faces.</p>

<p>Out on to the flat they dashed, and leaping off,
the two officers brought their teams to a sudden halt
within a dozen yards of the first tent.</p>

<p>“Wall, I’ll be squeegeed!” cried Cap’n Pem as he
turned at the sound of the party’s arrival.
“Where’n——” Then, catching sight of the boys’
companions he leaped forward with a hop and a skip.</p>

<p>“By the etarnal, I’m glad to see ye!” he cried.
“Nor’west perlice, ain’t ye? Where’n Sam Hill’d
these youngsters pick ye up?”</p>

<p>“Any trouble?” demanded Sergeant Manley without
stopping to reply to the old whaleman’s queries.</p>

<p>“Trouble!” exploded old Pem. “Mut’ny! Them
there critters has seized the <i>Ruby</i> an’ won’t let nary
a man aboard, dod gast their hides!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s the captain?” snapped out the sergeant
as he slipped his carbine from its sheath and Campbell
did the same.</p>

<p>“Here he comes,” said Tom. “What started the
mutiny, Cap’n Pem?”</p>

<p>“Them there gutter snipes!” replied the old whaleman.
“Said this here was a salvage job an’
wouldn’t stir hand nor foot lessen we give ’em half
the valer o’ the <i>Narwhal’s</i> cargo. I swan, I never
heered o’ sech a thing. Never knowed a whaleman
t’ talk o’ salvage. That’s what comes o’ these here
unions an’ new-fangled idees.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Captain Edwards, who now joined
the group with Mike and the other members of the
<i>Narwhal’s</i> company behind him. “See you’ve
brought reënforcements, boys. Glad you’re here, officers.”</p>

<p>“Understand you’ve a mutiny aboard,” said the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>“Not my ship,” replied the captain, “that’s the
trouble. We could rush ’em but they’ve got their
skipper an’ mates there and she’s a British ship and
I don’t know how far we Yankees could go.”</p>

<p>“Got any guns?” snapped out Manley.</p>

<p>“’Bout a dozen,” Captain Edwards assured him.</p>

<p>“Plenty!” declared the Sergeant. “Get your best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
men together, give them the guns, and I’ll take charge.
Campbell, get the kayaks ready.”</p>

<p>Throwing off his mackinaw, Sergeant Manley
strode forward, uttered sharp, crisp orders and with
twelve of the <i>Narwhal’s</i> crew, including Nate, one-eyed
Ned, Swanson, and Mr. Kemp, he marched to
the waiting kayaks, ordering the men to shoot and
shoot to kill if he gave the word. With ready carbine
he stepped into a canoe. Behind him came the
little flotilla. Instantly all was excitement on the
decks of the brigantine. Men ran here and there.
One or two leaped into the rigging, and the watching
boys saw the flash of steel, and the glint of gun
barrels.</p>

<p>“Golly, they’re going to fight!” exclaimed Jim.</p>

<p>“B’jabbers thin ’twill be a sorry day for thim!”
declared Mike. “’Tis the King’s constabulary they
do be afther resistin’, bad cess to thim.”</p>

<p>But the battle the boys expected never took place.
No sooner did the mutineers recognize the police
officers than all ideas of resistance were cast aside.
Clambering on to the rail a man waved a white
rag frantically in token of surrender. An instant
later the kayaks were alongside, and Sergeant Manley
and Campbell leaped over the bulwarks.</p>

<p>Cowed, with all the braggadocio gone from them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the <i>Ruby’s</i> crew backed away and stood muttering together
near the foremast.</p>

<p>“Where’s the captain and mate?” snapped out
the Sergeant, keeping the men covered with his
weapon.</p>

<p>“Aft, in the cabin,” replied one of the men.</p>

<p>“Search that crowd, Campbell!” ordered the Sergeant,
“and hold ’em.”</p>

<p>A minute later he reappeared accompanied by the
skipper and his chief officer.</p>

<p>“Those are the ringleaders,” declared the captain,
pointing to a big, bull-necked, low-browed fellow and
a weasel-faced, shifty-eyed creature. “They started
the trouble. Jones there’s the one killed the
bo’sun.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!” roared the heavy man. “S’help
me——”</p>

<p>“Silence!” roared Sergeant Manley. “Here,
Campbell——”</p>

<p>With a quick motion, the bull-necked fellow
whipped out a revolver. There was a sharp report
and the mutineer plunged forward upon the deck
and his gun clattered upon the planking. Campbell
nonchalantly threw out the empty shell and snapped
another into his carbine.</p>

<p>Terrified at the death of their leader, the mutineers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
already frightened at the realization of their
position, drew back with blanched faces while the
rat-faced ringleader fell on his knees and pleaded
for mercy.</p>

<p>“Get up!” ordered the Sergeant, and as the fellow
rose a pair of handcuffs snapped upon his wrists.</p>

<p>“We’ll take him along with us,” announced Sergeant
Manley. “Any others you want to lose, Captain?”</p>

<p>“I’d jolly well like to lose the whole bally lot,”
replied the skipper earnestly, “but I can’t. Got
to handle the ship you know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think they’ll give you further trouble,” declared
the Sergeant. “Have ’em searched. Keep
’em workin’ an’ carry a gun—each of you. Don’t
forget you’re on a British ship and labor unions
don’t go under that flag. You’re boss and let ’em
know it. Expect those Yankees’ll be glad to lend
you a hand with this crowd.”</p>

<p>Presently Captain Edwards and old Pem, with the
remaining members of the <i>Narwhal’s</i> crew, came
aboard; the few belongings of the shipwrecked whalemen
were stowed and preparations were made for
departure.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll go along with you to Rowe’s Welcome,”
said Sergeant Manley as the whale boats were lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and the repentant crew prepared to tow the <i>Ruby</i>
out of the worst of the ice. “Have to report the
loss of the <i>Narwhal</i>, and I’d like to see you safe on
your way. Campbell, take the dogs and go overland.”</p>

<p>Then, as the brigantine moved slowly from the inlet,
bumping her blunt bows into the floating ice and
grinding between the cakes which went bobbing
astern, the boys had their first chance to tell the
story of their adventures.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, this cruise is over—or near it!”
cried Captain Edwards. “I’d be a nervous wreck if
I had you boys to look after much longer, even if
you do always come out smilin’ as a clam.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be b’iled if ye can’t git into more consarned
scrapes’n a passel o’ monkeys!” declared Cap’n Pem.
“Fast as ye’re outen one ye’re into a wusser.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp spat reflectively into the sea. “Some
kids,” he remarked tersely.</p>

<p>At last the brigantine was clear of the shore ice,
ahead stretched patches and lanes of open water,
and under a light wind the <i>Ruby</i> went bumping and
crashing on her way towards Rowe’s Welcome and
the stove <i>Narwhal</i>.</p>

<p>“I suppose you men have a heap of queer adventures,”
remarked Mr. Kemp as Sergeant Manley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
stopped for a chat. “I was mate with a chap what
was in the force once, when I was on the destroyer.”</p>

<p>The Sergeant smiled. “Yes, we get our share,”
he replied, “but most of ’em pretty much alike—runnin’
down renegades and outlaws. If any one
wants plenty of exercise and out-doors air, I’ll recommend
the force. To-day’s job’s the queerest I
ever had yet, though. A Northwest policeman’s
supposed to do most anything that turns up, but
I’d never have dreamed of bein’ called on to board a
ship and put down a mutiny.”</p>

<p>The next day the <i>Ruby</i> worked her way past Southampton
Island into the Welcome. Eagerly the boys
peered ahead for the first glimpse of the <i>Narwhal</i>
and the village of their Eskimo friends.</p>

<p>“It’s been a fine cruise,” declared Jim, “but it
makes me feel almost sick to think of leaving the
old <i>Narwhal</i> here.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” snorted Cap’n Pem. “Ships has got
ter go sometimes—same’s folks. Reckon the Welcome’s
as good a place’s any ter let her ol’ bones rest.
’Sides, ye won’t lose nothin’, Dixon had her insured
ter the limit.”</p>

<p>“That’s not it,” said Tom. “It’s like losing an
old friend. Why, you know how we’d feel if we
left you or any of the others up here, Cap’n Pem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The old whaleman turned his head, blew his nose
loudly on his red cotton handkerchief and cleared
his throat. “Derned if I don’t know jes how ye
feel,” he replied. “Hate fer to see a ol’ ship go
myself. Wall, there ain’t no help fer it. Everlastin’
lucky we salvaged all the cargo.”</p>

<p>“And luckier yet the <i>Ruby</i> was up here,” added
Captain Edwards.</p>

<p>“Seems to me the whole trip’s been lucky—no
matter what happened,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Even with the cat,” laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“Gosh, where is she?” cried Tom. “I’d forgotten
all about her and her kittens.”</p>

<p>“Lef’ her an’ t’others behin’,” said Cap’n Pem.
“Ye didn’t think we could be a-totin’ a passel o’
cats ’long o’ us on that there sledge trip, did ye?
Jes the same, I reckon I got ter take back what I
said erbout her. Mebbe times has changed an’ cats
is lucky now’days, what with injines an’ bumb lances
an’ perlice a-puttin’ down mut’nies an’ all sech new-fangled
contraptions.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah, you do admit it!” cried Jim. “If we
keep on we’ll knock all your superstitions to pieces.”</p>

<p>But Cap’n Pem had not waited to hear.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the <i>Ruby</i> rounded a jutting
cape and there, before them, was the well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
cove with the <i>Narwhal</i>, forsaken and deserted, looming
above the cakes of ice.</p>

<p>“Why, why—Gosh! She’s afloat!” cried Tom,
hardly able to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Holy mackerel, she is!” agreed Mr. Kemp.</p>

<p>“I’ll be blowed!” exclaimed Captain Edwards.
“By glory, we may go home in her yet!”</p>

<p>With wondering eyes the crew of the <i>Narwhal</i>
gazed upon their schooner, for the ship they had left
with her deck bulging above the bulwarks from the
terrific pressure of the ice; the vessel whose stern had
been raised high in air and that they were positive
would sink to the bottom of the bay when the ice broke
up, was now floating on an even keel, low in the
water to be sure, but apparently sound and unhurt.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the <i>Ruby’s</i> anchor dropped over before
Captain Edwards, Pem, Mr. Kemp, and the boys
tumbled into a boat and were pulled rapidly to the
<i>Narwhal</i>. Grasping the main chains, Tom leaped
on to the deck and as he did so a ball of black fur
sprang from a coil of rope and with a friendly
“meow” the ship’s cat rubbed herself against the
boy’s legs.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he shouted as the others jumped on to
the deck. “It’s all right, here’s the cat!”</p>

<p>“Waall, I’ll be everlastin’ly swizzled!” cried Cap’n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Pem as he looked about. “The ol’ deck’s dropped
inter place. I’ll be b’iled if I think there’s a mite
the matter with her!”</p>

<p>“Five feet of water in the hold,” announced Mr.
Kemp who had been sounding the well.</p>

<p>“Course there is,” replied the captain. “May
have sprung a leak, but if she did, it’s stopped now.
If it hadn’t she’d have sunk. Reckon she dove off
the ice too an’ shipped some down the for’ard hatch.
Men, what do you say? Shall we take the chance
and sail in the old <i>Narwhal</i>?”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye!” responded the men in chorus. “No
lime juicers for us, long’s the schooner’s a-floatin’.”</p>

<p>“But how—how could she be squeezed all together
as she was and be all right now?” asked Tom.
“Why, her deck was like a hill and her bulwarks
were bent in.”</p>

<p>Cap’n Pem chuckled and rubbed his hands together
in glee. “Didn’t I tell ye whaleships was
built to las’ forever?” he cried. “Bless yer souls!
what’s a mite o’ squeezin’ to a ol’ hooker like the
<i>Narwhal</i>. I bet ye she’s a-sailin’ an’ a-crusin’ an’
a-gettin’ jammed in the ice arter you an’ me and the
rest ’re dead an’ gone. Yes, sir, nothin’ like a
Yankee whaleship!”</p>

<p>All having agreed that they would sail home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the <i>Narwhal</i>, the crew were transferred from the
<i>Ruby</i>. Then Sergeant Manley bade them all good
luck and a quick voyage, and joining Campbell, who
had arrived the day previously, he sped swiftly into
the southwest towards distant Fort Churchill with
his rat-faced mutineer prisoner.</p>

<p>With doleful shakes of his head the skipper of
the <i>Ruby</i> said farewell, muttering something about
“Yankees taking chances where no sane man would,”
and hoisting sail, he headed his tubby old craft for
the open sea.</p>

<p>Working steadily, toiling for hour after hour, the
men pumped the water from the <i>Narwhal</i>. They
labored with light hearts, for steadily they gained and
when at last the pumps sucked, and the following
day the sounding rod showed less than a foot of
water, all knew that the schooner was tight and safe.
Rapidly the long deck house was dismantled, the big
foretopmast yard was sent up to the words of a
rousing chantey, sails were bent on and running rigging
rove. Then, like beavers, the men and the Eskimos
toiled, bringing the casks of oils, the bales of
whalebone, the great bundles of skins and hides, the
sacks of ivory, and the countless other valuables, as
well as stores and supplies, from the shore.</p>

<p>At last all was done. The last of the cargo was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
stowed. The standing rigging was taut and well
tarred. The carpenter had patched the cracked
rails and bulwarks, and had relaid some
of the deck planks. The motor had been overhauled
and tested. The sails hung loosely in their brails
and the boats were at their davits. All this had taken
much time to accomplish, and the Arctic spring had
come swiftly to the land. The hills and valleys
showed gray and bare. The black rocks loomed
above the patches of sodden snow. The ice, rotten
and spongy, had almost disappeared from the bay.
The Eskimos’ igloos had long since gone, and the
natives were living in their skin tents once more.
Far overhead in the blue sky, the long files of geese
and swans winged northward; great flocks of eiders
gathered on the bay; curlew and snipe filled the night
air with their plaintive whistling, and the snowbirds
twittered from rocks and last year’s weeds.</p>

<p>For the last time the boys paddled ashore in their
kayak and bade farewell to Nepaluka, to Newilic,
to Kemiplu, the wrinkled old story teller, and to all
their Eskimo friends whom they had grown to love
and respect.</p>

<p>Then the clank of the windlass and the rousing
chantey of the men warned them it was time to leave,
and swiftly they paddled to the schooner, gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
farewell wave of their hands to the crowd of Eskimos
ashore, and saw their little kayak hoisted to the deck.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent1">Blow ye winds westerly, gentle sou’westerly</div>
<div class="verse">Blow ye winds westerly—steady she goes!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Loudly the chantey rang over the bay. Loudly the
Eskimos shouted and yelled as the dripping chain
came in link by link, and the great anchor rose
from the mud that had held it fast for half a year.
Up the rigging the men sped. Quickly the huge
sails were spread and sheeted home. Braces were
manned, and the <i>Narwhal</i> slowly gathered way and
the short seas splashed in spray from her forefoot.
Out towards the vast reaches of the bay she sailed.
Behind her, the land grew dim and faint. To a
fair, stiff breeze she heeled, with every sail drawing,
headed southward.</p>

<p>Battered by countless storms, scarred by ice, the
veteran of a thousand battles with hurricanes and
tempest, with crushing floes and grinding bergs, still
staunch and sound, the gallant old schooner lifted
her bow and plunged through the hissing green seas.</p>

<p>Safe within her old hold were the hard won treasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of the Arctic; yard long icicles and masses of
frozen spray draped her bobstays, her rails, and
her chains. But shaking the icy brine from her
decks as she reared on the crests of the waves, sliding
into the great hollows, crushing ice cakes with
her shearing bows, she tore onward, while at braces
and halyards and sheets the men roared out that most
welcome and glorious of whaleman’s songs:</p>
